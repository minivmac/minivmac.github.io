Pratt" tabindex="2"> </p>	<p> <input type="hidden" name="p4701" value="xym0w6s4"> </p></form><p>After clicking on the Send button, you should see a pageconfirming your message has been sent to me.</p><p>If a reply seems required, I will post your messageand my reply to the</p><blockquote><p> <a href="mail/latest.html">Mail Archive</a>  (latest) </p></blockquote><p>For best results, ask a single specific question,or request some specific action of me. Longermessages without a specific point I tend to set asideto deal with later, and then a few months later decideit's too late to do anything about.</p><p>I'm happy to answer questions about Mini vMac, as it is an opportunityto improve the documentation. However, if you don'tlook at the documentation, no improvements wouldhelp. So please spend at least a minute or two lookingfor an answer to your question in the<a href="minivmac/index.html">documentation</a>or <a href="minivmac/faq.html">FAQ</a>before asking me. (If you figure out the answer yourself, butdon't think the documentation is very clear, let me knowhow to improve it.)</p><p>Bug reports, patches, and website proofreading are alwaysmost welcome.</p><p>Another option for feedback is to send email to this address:</p><blockquote><p><img src="../d/gry_addr.gif" width=207 height=25 alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></p></blockquote><p>The above is a picture to help avoid attracting spam, so you will needto type in the address. Note that emails to this address will be treatedthe same as messages sent by the form - questions and responses maybe posted to the Mail Archive. Be aware that email is not completelyreliable. You can check the Mail Archive to see if I received youremail, and whether I have responded to it.</p><p>Another option for asking questions is one of various internet<a href="forums/index.html">forums related to Mini vMac</a>.I can only try to be the definitive source of information about Mini vMac.For other related subjects, having a larger audience is likely to getbetter results.</p><!--<p>If you haven't included your email address, and expecta reply, check the mail archive. Actually, I preferto reply via the mail archive, since email is notalways reliable, and keeping discussion publicallows other to benefit. Still, private email issometimes more appropriate, such as to discuss a patchbefore making it public.</p><p> I will read all messages, but because of limited timeI may not reply quickly, or at all. So a betteroption for asking questions may be one of various internet<a href="../c/forums/index.html">forums related to Mini vMac</a>,where there are more people who can answer. But for the quickestanswer to your question, first try the<a href="../c/minivmac/faq.html">FAQ</a>and<a href="../c/minivmac/index.html">documentation</a>.</p><p> <b>Important:</b> If you have a question about usingMini vMac, this is not the place to ask. Instead, askon one of various internet<a href="../c/forums/index.html">forums related to Mini vMac</a>.I check a couple of the forums as often as I do messages from thisform. And I'm more motivated to respond on the forums, since itmay help other people, not just the person asking. More importantly,someone else may answer your question. I'm often withoutinternet access for a week or more, and even when I do haveinternet access I don't check mail all that often.(For the quickest answer to your question, first try the<a href="../c/minivmac/faq.html">FAQ</a>and<a href="../c/minivmac/index.html">documentation</a>.)</p><p> If you have some news you think I would be interested in,announce it on one of the forums, and I will see theannouncement. <p><p> One appropriate use of this form is to report a typo orother mistake on the Mini vMac website. It's quick and easy,and there is a link to this feedback form at the topof every page. </p><p> This form can also be used to send Mini vMac bug reports orpatches. I'll read feature requests, but not usually respondto them. I already have far more possible things todo then time available, so requesting features is not likely tobe productive. If you would like to implement a featureyourself, I'd be more interested in providing whatassistance I can. </p>--><hr><div><i> <a href="../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/feedback </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
