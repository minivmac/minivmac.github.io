I now have a much smaller amount of code that given a signedmessage and a public key in ascii armored format, will check thesignature. I just have to clean it up to make a Macintosh program thatcan be used to check all the many signed checksums on this website.</p><p>(I think that these days it would actually be legal to distribute MacPGPhere, but it would be necessary to fill out a form to notify thegovernment, which I&rsquo;d rather not deal with. Making a utility thatonly deals with digital signatures, rather than general encryption, Ithink avoids this issue. Also, a simple utility ought to be easier touse.)</p><p><a name="n171126"> <b>November 26, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n171126">permanent link</a></p><p>I&rsquo;ve increased the limit to 25 for the maximum number of requestsper day to the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>.This is just to make sure that no one who is using the servicereasonably needs to worry about the limit.</p><p>The download page for a sponsored variation now displays the number ofremaining requests available for the day. This limit is actuallyper build server, but this distinction doesn&rsquo;t usually matter,since usually only a single build server is active, except forbrief maintenance periods.</p><p>Mostly this week I have been looking at the source code for MacPGP.The Gryphel Project website has lots of signed checksums, butdoesn&rsquo;t provide a way to check the signatures. So I&rsquo;mlooking into whether it is possible to create a simple utilityto do this kind of check.</p><p> ------ </p><p>Thanks to Johan Klassen and Chris Hansonfor <a href="../wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>over a month of web hosting for the Gryphel project.</p><p><a name="n171119"> <b>November 19, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n171119">permanent link</a></p><p>With yet more optimizations, the turnaround time for the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>is now usually down to 30 seconds (from one minute last week).</p><p> ------ </p><p>Thanks to Gianluca Abbiati, Malte Meyer, and Luis Hernandezfor <a href="../wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>over 3 months of web hosting for the Gryphel project.</p><p><a name="n171112"> <b>November 12, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n171112">permanent link</a></p><p>With assorted optimizations, the turnaround time for the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>is now usually down to one minute (from two minutes last week, andhours before last week).</p><p><a name="n171105"> <b>November 5, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n171105">permanent link</a></p><p>I have set up an old Macintosh (Intel) to be dedicated tocompiling variations for the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>.This speeds up turnaround from hours to minutes. (At least whenit is running. The scripts are designed to halt on first error, so thatwhen I check on the machine later, it is easier to tell what happened,and try to make sure it doesn't happen again. So reliability shouldincrease over time.)</p><p>The Variations Service has been reworked to allow more than onemachine to do compiles. Eventually this might be useful in meetinglarger demands than one machine can handle. But the much moreimmediate use is to make maintenance simpler. I can set mymain computer to compiling variations while doing maintenanceon the old Macintosh, so there is no interruption in service.</p><p>Supporting more than one machine doing compiles at the sametime has consequences. Both machines trying to updatea single list of the latest compiled variations would bemessy, so that list has gone away. Instead, when a variationis requested, a new web page is made for it (which says thatthe variation is being compiled), and when the variationis compiled, the web page is replaced with a new versionthat has a download link and md5 checksum. Both machinescan write such pages at the same time, since they are writingto different pages.</p><p><a name="n171029"> <b>October 29, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n171029">permanent link</a></p><p>I&rsquo;m back from travel. After considering feedback, I haveimplemented a new way to use the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>.With the increased automation in the build system to reduce the costof making variations, I can now offer as many variations as you canreasonably want for a year for a single donation of ten dollars or more.Where reasonable is defined as up to ten per day, every day.

After the a dialog window, such as for open disk image,the mouse position would not be updated until the mouse moved. SoMini vMac now checks the mouse position after dialogs. A harderproblem is the mouse position would not be updated after using themenubar, or window controls such as the close box (clicking and draggingoff the control, so the window isn&rsquo;t closed, and the mouseis moved). Mini vMacisn&rsquo;t notified about these clicks. So instead now whenever MinivMac notices that it hasn&rsquo;t been given time to run for longenough, it will check the mouse position, which usually will take careof these cases. Perhaps it would have been simpler to find some way ofgetting the correct mouse position while dragging the Mini vMac window.But it is nicer, and ought to be more efficient, to rely on events formouse position when possible, rather than constantly asking the OS wherethe mouse is.</p><p>The recent report about odd behavior on a Windows 10 tabletmay now be <a href="../mail/v5.html#m26">understood</a>, with nofix needed.</p><p>There are new pages for links to software for Mini vMac,using a format more consistent with hosted software, for:<a href="../sw/games/foolserr/index.html">The Fool&rsquo;s Errand</a>,<a href="../sw/games/atthecar/index.html">At the Carnival</a>,<a href="../sw/games/thrinthr/index.html">3 in Three</a>,<a href="../sw/sysutils/diskfaid/index.html">Disk First Aid</a>,<a href="../sw/sysutils/diskcopy/index.html">Disk Copy</a>,<a href="../sw/sysutils/truetype/index.html">TrueType&trade;</a>,<a href="../sw/archive/compactp/index.html">Compact Pro</a>,<a href="../sw/general/acta/index.html">Acta</a>, and<a href="../sw/general/more/index.html">MORE</a>.</p><p> ------ </p><p>Thanks to Shitara Zenyafor <a href="../wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>over 3 days of web hosting, and a variation, for the Gryphel project.(Which also led to finding the Cocoa clipboard import issue.)</p><p><a name="n170702"> <b>July 2, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n170702">permanent link</a></p><p>The<a href="../minivmac/b_var.html">Beta Variations Service</a>now allows arbitrary screen sizes.

These two reportssuggest the problem is not a new call to report an Abnormal Situationfor what is actually a normal situation, but instead that something israndomly accessing memory. So I think the next step is to write(optional) debugging code to catch unusual accesses to memory, togreatly increase the percent of the address space that generates anabnormal situation report, hopefully making the reports much morefrequent.</p><p> ------ </p><p>Thanks to William Winterfor <a href="../wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>over 2 weeks of web hosting for the Gryphel project.</p><p><a name="n170618"> <b>June 18, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n170618">permanent link</a></p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/macshell/index.html">MacShell</a>,<a href="../sw/other/msim/index.html">MicroArchitecture Simulator</a>, and<a href="../sw/other/pdp8esim/index.html">PDP-8/E Simulator</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve finally obtained OS X 10.12 (Sierra),and verified the<a href="../mail/v5.html#m3">reported</a><a href="../mail/v5.html#m18">(twice)</a>problem with the newPath Randomization &ldquo;feature&rdquo;.The operating system can copy the application somewhere else beforeexecuting it.

If you switched to Mini vMac using command-tab,the mouse position wasn&rsquo;t updated until the mouseis moved. This is fixed by fetching the current mouseposition when Mini vMac is activated, rather than onlyrely on mouse movement events. (Before 3.5.5, the Cocoaport would frequently fetch the mouse position, whichwas giving incorrect results during dragging theMini vMac window.)</p><p>If Mini vMac reports an &ldquo;Abnormal Situation&rdquo;, it nowalso displays a 4 digit hexadecimal number. The original idea wasthat if something unexpected happens, you should first figure out howto reproduce the problem. Then the same thing can be done on a copyof Mini vMac with debugging stuff enabled. But this ideadoesn&rsquo;t work out so well if the problem can&rsquo;t bereproduced, and seems to happen randomly and rarely. Which iswhat has happened. Over a few weeks I saw a couple Abnormal Situationreports in the beta that I couldn&rsquo;t reproduce. Mini vMacworked fine afterwards, so I suspect that the report was not needed,it is just a situation that is rare but valid. I just need tofind out which report, out of couple hundred, to remove. SoI enabled debug logging and continued to use Mini vMac for weeks. Andso far it has worked perfectly, unfortunately. Maybe I justhaven&rsquo;t used it enough.</p><p>So now in today&rsquo;s version the regular non debug Mini vMac willdisplay a number when reporting an Abnormal Situation,which doesn&rsquo;t take much additional code. So if anyoneruns across this issue, you can tell me this 4 digit hexadecimal number,and I will know exactly which report to remove.</p><p>(By the way, an explanation for all these&ldquo;Abnormal Situation&rdquo; reports:When trying to emulate some aspect of Macintosh hardware, mycurrent strategy is not to try to figure it all out and thenimplement the entire emulation as best I can. Because ifI did that, inevitably there would be a mistake somewhere,and when that causes some software to malfunction, I won&rsquo;thave any clue of where to look for the mistake.Instead I wouldstart with a place holder Abnormal Situation report. ThenI find some Macintosh software that reaches that report, andlook at that area of its code, and try to figure out whatit is trying to do. Then I try to implement just enoughemulation for it to work correctly, and give anAbnormal Situation report for code that does something else.If the Macintosh software still doesn't work, the problem isprobably in the code I just wrote. If it does work, then I nexttry find some other Macintosh software that hits one of thenew Abnormal Situation reports. And iterate. The result iscode that is usually correct for what it does, and will tell youexactly where to look when it reaches something that hasn&rsquo;tbeen implemented yet.)</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/sndconv/index.html">SndConverter Pro</a>,<a href="../sw/other/sndctlg/index.html">SndCataloguer</a>,<a href="../sw/other/sndclctr/index.html">SndCollector</a>,<a href="../sw/other/simpcard/index.html">Simple Card</a>, and<a href="../sw/other/gene/index.html">Gene</a>.And some software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectwhere the original web pages have disappeared:<a href="../sw/other/fit2eps/index.html">FIT2EPS</a> and<a href="../sw/other/ezindex/index.html">EZIndex</a>.</p><p><a name="n170528"> <b>May 28, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n170528">permanent link</a></p><p> Testing proceeds on the<a href="../minivmac/beta.html">Mini vMac 3.5.5</a>beta.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/sigquot/index.html">SignatureQuote</a>,<a href="../sw/other/swapper/index.html">Swapper</a>,<a href="../sw/other/kb7to8/index.html">kb8to7 and kb7to8</a>,<a href="../sw/other/chunkjn/index.html">ChunkJoiner</a>,<a href="../sw/other/encrpntr/index.html">Encryptinator</a>, and<a href="../sw/other/chksum/index.html">Checksum</a>.And some software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectwhere the original web pages have disappeared:<a href="../sw/other/findinfl/index.html">Find In Files</a>,<a href="../sw/other/txttomac/index.html">TextToMac</a>,<a href="../sw/other/alexencr/index.html">Alex&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>, and<a href="../sw/other/verifile/index.html">Verifile</a>.</p><p><a name="n170521"> <b>May 21, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n170521">permanent link</a></p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/macbalsa/index.html">MacBALSA</a>.</p><p> Testing proceeds on the<a href="../minivmac/beta.html">Mini vMac 3.5.5</a>beta.

Previously Mini vMac3.5 used a non-standard stack alignment for Macintosh Plus emulationon x86-32, when compiled with GCC 4.7.4 (with the&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/develop.html#option_e">-e mvc</a>&rdquo;option), which results in smaller and faster code. However, for OS X,any calls to external libraries could crash, and such calls canbe generated by the compiler itself. For Macintosh II emulation,such a call is generated for 64 bit division, so previously thenon standard alignment was not used. Now instead Mini vMac containsits own (not particularly good) implementation of 64 bit division,used for CPU architectures which don't directly provide it and thecompiler would generate a library call. So the non-standard stackalignment can be used. To make it easy to detect if the compilergenerates any other problematic calls, on OS X Mini vMac is nowlinked without the compiler libraries (for GCC 4.7.4).</p><p>Compiling with GCC 4.7.4 previously generated warning messagesabout &ldquo;aliasing&rdquo;. A C compiler is allowed to assumethat two pointers of different types don't point to thesame memory location. But this assumption could break Mini vMac.So now for GCC 4.7.4 the option &ldquo;-fno-strict-aliasing&rdquo;is used to prevent this assumption, which appears to makeno significant difference in speed. But for other compilers,Mini vMac will now try to work correctly even with this assumption(basically by taking out optimizations for big/little endian),which will slow it down a bit.</p><p>Also in this version, a bug is fixed in the Cocoa port, whereit would draw incorrectly in full screen mode if the emulatedscreen is larger than real screen.</p><p>Also fixed is a bug in lazy evaluation of condition flags forthe Tst instruction and similar.</p><p><a name="n170226"> <b>February 26, 2017</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n170226">permanent link</a></p><p>In the latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshot,the emulation of the coprocessor instructions (F line instructions) isreworked to not use the opcode, but instead only use the entry for theopcode in the OpDispatch table.

Also it easier to tweakC code to get good performance for a single compiler,than to try to make code that is optimum for all C compilers.The C code for the CPU emulation on x86-32 using GCC 4.7.4is now about as fast as the old hard to maintain and limited handtweaked assembly language code.</p><p>Previously I had compiled from GCC 4.7.4 native compilers forOS X (x86-32 and x86-64). This week I followed the<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw-w64/wiki2/Cross%20Win32%20and%20Win64%20compiler/">instructions for MinGW-w64</a>,which worked perfectly to build cross compilers and supporting filesfor Window (x86-32 and x86-64). Next I can look intobuilding cross compilers targeting Linux.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/manmakr/index.html">Manual Maker</a>.</p><p><a name="n161211"> <b>December 11, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva6.html#n161211">permanent link</a></p><p>In the latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshot,the build system is updated to produce more optimized compilesfor Windows x86-32, Linux x86-32 and Linux x86-64, forthe specific compiler versions I use. (As was previously donefor OS X x86-32.) There is also some further fixes and tweaksto the CPU emulation code.</p><p>But it is unsatisfactory for Mini vMac tooperate at different speedson different operating systems because of using different Ccompilers (unlike in Mini vMac 3.4.1, where the same assemblylanguage code is used). A possible solution is to use the same compiler,by making gcc cross-compilers. This may be easier said than done.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/other/manmakr/index.html">Manual Maker</a>.</p><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="nva5.html">Older News</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">news</a>/nva6- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i></div></body></html>
