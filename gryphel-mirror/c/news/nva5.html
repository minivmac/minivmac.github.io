The build system onlygenerates the special compiler options for the specific compilerversion I use (and use for the Variations Service), since verifyingthat they work and work well for all possible versions of gcc would beextremely time consuming. For other compiler versions, with only themore generic options, it will work, but may not be quite as fast.</p><p>But most of the work this week was in further refinements oflazy evaluation of the condition code register, and in numerousother tweaks to improve the code generated by the compiler.</p><p><a name="n161127"> <b>November 27, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161127">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshotcontinues work on the C language version of CPU emulation.</p><p>With further refinement, the code using lazy evaluation of thecondition code register is of similar speed on x86 to thecode using immediate evaluation. So I have removed the immediateevaluation code, because I think lazy evaluation is a bettermatch for the C language.</p><p><a name="n161120"> <b>November 20, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161120">permanent link</a></p><p>In the latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshot,I've experimented with seeing how much faster I could make theC language version of the CPU emulation if I didn't worry aboutkeeping the assembly language versions compatible.</p><p>The first particular change that made the assembly languageincompatible was to the disp_table array set up by M68KITAB.c,merging the Address Mode and Argument Kind fields. So insteadof the CPU emulation having one switch for decoding addresses,and a second switch for getting or setting, there is a single switchthat decodes and gets, or decodes and sets. Making the code lesscompact, but faster. (That&rsquo;s the basic idea, there are a fewcomplications.)</p><p>The C version is now nearly as fast as the x86 assembly (witha particular compiler and compiler options). Of course the samechanges could be made to both assembly language versions making themfaster yet, but that would take a very long time. Instead I'veremoved the assembly language to allow faster progress.</p><p>So now Mini vMac is a bit slower on x86-32 and PowerPC, but on theother hand, it should be faster elsewhere. And the Macintosh IIemulation should be faster. (The assembly language was for 68000 only.)</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/general/addrnote/index.html">Address Notebook</a> and<a href="../sw/other/edoc/index.html">eDoc</a>.</p><p> ------ </p><p>Thanks to Donovan Prestonfor <a href="../wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>over 2 months of web hosting for the Gryphel project.</p><p><a name="n161113"> <b>November 13, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161113">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshothas a new build option to not grab the keyboard in Full Screen Mode.</p><p>Normally, when in Full Screen Mode, Mini vMacwill try to &ldquo;grab&rdquo; the keyboard, preventing the operatingsystem from intercepting keys. So in the Windows version,the &lsquo;windows&rsquo; key can be used as an &lsquo;option&rsquo; key, insteadof popping up the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; menu. And in theOS X version, Command-Tab won't switch away from Mini vMac.This is also implemented in the X version. There is a new build option,<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_gkf">-gkf 0</a>&rdquo;, thatdisables grabbing the keyboard, allowingthe operating system to intercept keys when Mini vMac isin Full Screen Mode. This was<a href="../mail/v3.html#m70">requested</a>by a maintainer for &ldquo;Rocket Launcher&rdquo;.</p><p>Mostly, this week I was contemplating C compilers. On further testing,the GCC 4.7.4 C compiler I compiled last week produces a significantlyslower Mini vMac than the much older version I having been using,and I haven't found any way to improve it. One particular problemis that it seems to be more conservative about&ldquo;-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2&rdquo;. So with the bestcompiler tried so far, at best the C language version is about twothirds as fast as the assembly language version, which I don't findsatisfactory.</p><p><a name="n161106"> <b>November 6, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161106">permanent link</a></p><p>In the latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshot,the C language version of 680x0 emulation is roughly 10 percentfaster, at least with the old GCC compiler I develop with (froman old Xcode). Changing the command line arguments can geta bit faster yet. (The changed arguments are not yet in theMini vMac build system.)</p><p>The motivation was that, last week as I was setting up to make changesto the PowerPC assembly language to match changes previously madeto the C language and X86 language version of the 680x0 emulation,I had doubts whether it was good idea. Assembly languageprogramming is fun, but slow. Keeping 3 versions ofthe 680x0 emulation in sync slows progress by more thana factor of 3. Eventually adding versions for ARM andx86-64 would make things worse. And adding support to theassembly language for 68020 for faster Mac II emulation doesn&rsquo;tseem feasible.</p><p>The assembly language versions are barely twice as fast asthe C version in Mini vMac 3.4.1. Perhaps with some further tweakingand using a more recent compiler, the C language versioncould be made almost as fast, and the assembly language couldbe removed, allowing faster progress.</p><p>Last week&rsquo;s experiment with lazy flag evaluation wasn&rsquo;t verysuccessful, but this week an assortment of tweaks has madea significant difference. The main one is to use tables offunction pointers rather than switch statements in a numberof places. Another was to fiddle with the flag evaluationcode. (Also there is now a more careful distinction between0/1 and boolean variables. Previously Mini vMac wouldn&rsquo;twork correctly if a compiler didn&rsquo;t represent "true" as 1.I don&rsquo;t know if it works now, I haven&rsquo;t encountered sucha compiler, but now it might.)</p><p>Also this week, I managed to compile GCC 4.7.4 (the final versionimplemented in C rather than C++) in OS X, using the GCCcompiler in X code 4.1. It doesn&rsquo;t immediately seemto result in a faster Mini vMac, but it has some additionaloptions that could be useful. More interesting is thepossibility of compiling cross-compilers.</p><p>A motivation for the assembly language was that anyone cancompile Mini vMac with whatever compiler and get nearlyidentical performance, as the cpu emulation is the same.But with the Variations Service, I consider this lessimportant now. I mostly only need to worry about the performanceof the compilers that I use. This is further simplifiedif I mostly use one compiler, which can be compiledfor many different targets, as GCC can. It is still importantthat Mini vMac can be compiled with any C compiler, the resultjust may not be as fast.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/general/netcal/index.html">Network Calender</a> and<a href="../sw/general/hapclock/index.html">HappyPlusClock</a>.And some software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectwhere the original web pages have disappeared:<a href="../sw/general/birthday/index.html">Birthdays and Such</a> and<a href="../sw/general/ezcal/index.html">EZCalendar</a>.</p><p><a name="n161030"> <b>October 30, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161030">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshothas an experiment in &ldquo;lazy evaluation&rdquo;of the condition code register in the emulation of the 680x0.It can be enabled by setting HaveLazyFlags to 1 in&ldquo;EM68KGEN.c&rdquo;So far it doesn&rsquo;t seem to demonstrate the hoped for benefits,but there is more to try.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/general/addrbook/index.html">Big Al Address Book</a>.And some software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectwhere the original web pages have disappeared:<a href="../sw/archive/hqxer/index.html">HQXer</a> and<a href="../sw/general/popaddr/index.html">PopAddress</a>.</p><p><a name="n161023"> <b>October 23, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n161023">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshothas a couple bug fixes in the x86 assembly language version of the CPUemulation, which makes it work properly with testing code thatscrambles the mapping between emulated memory.

Since this is only a bad read,I don&rsquo;t think any further harm is possible besides crashing MinivMac. Most kinds of memory access emulated by Mini vMac have for a quitewhile have been designed to always be accurate and safe. But for speed,fetching the next instruction would simply increment a pointer to wherethe instruction is in real memory, and relative branches would justoffset this pointer. Only for certain long branches would Mini vMac workout from scratch where the instruction is in real memory. This is goodenough for all known correctly working software. But it is in theorypossible to write code so that the pointer to the next instruction getsset to arbitrary memory that the operating system may not allow MinivMac to access, resulting in a crash. And not just in theory, I haveseen this happen in programs running in Mini vMac that weremalfunctioning.</p><p>This bug is fixed by keeping low and high limits forthe instruction pointer, and checking against them as the pointer ischanged. When fetching the next instruction, it only needs tocheck against the high limit. And the increment and checkis done after the current instruction is fetched, and so itcould be done in parallel with other things. A modern computercan do several things at once as long as they don&rsquo;t interferewith each other. So it shouldn&rsquo;t affect speed too much.</p><p>Actually, at first it slowed things down a lot. But then Ifigured out it was because the compiler I use fordevelopment messed up with the C inline directive. I figuredout how to get the compiler to inline if and only ifI tell it to, which gained back all speed lost, and a littlebit more. So now the build system defined macros MayNotInlineor MayInline are used for every function in Mini vMac.</p><p>The ability to turn off USE_POINTER and FastRelativeJump forgreater accuracy is removed from the source code, since they are nowalways accurate and safe.</p><p>These changes have only been made in the C implementation of CPUemulation so far. The PowerPC and x86 assembly languages versions areto be fixed next.</p><p>The same thing has been done to the assembly language sourceas previously was done API, sound, and language sources. Theyhave been given unique names and moved to the main source folder.(Which has been renamed from &ldquo;c_src&rdquo; to &ldquo;src&rdquo;since it is no longer just C.) Also, instead of the build systemtransforming the PowerPC code for MPW, there are two PowerPC versions,and some scripts (in the new file &ldquo;trans&rdquo;) to helpkeep them in sync. The idea being moved to is that the buildsystem only generates configuration files, and the source folderis the source, basically the same in the source archive and whenbeing compiled.</p><p>The motivation for working on the CPU emulation is that I would like tomake assembly language versions for ARM and X86-64, but there areissues, such as today&rsquo;s safe instruction fetching, that would be alot easier to deal with first, before there are more versions to keep insysnc.</p><p>Some more software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectinstead of only linked to:<a href="../sw/sysutils/ficleanr/index.html">Folder Icon Cleaner</a>,<a href="../sw/sysutils/prefscln/index.html">PrefsCleaner</a>,<a href="../sw/progtool/clearres/index.html">ClearRes</a>,and<a href="../sw/sysutils/aliascrn/index.html">Alias Crony</a>.And some software is now hosted by the Gryphel Projectwhere the original web pages have disappeared:<a href="../sw/sysutils/powrpchk/index.html">PowerPCheck</a>,<a href="../sw/sysutils/stripppc/index.html">StripPPC</a>,and<a href="../sw/sysutils/dodelete/index.html">DoDelete</a>.</p><p><a name="n160911"> <b>September 11, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n160911">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshothas some further work on the SDL 2.0 port.

Often, butnot always, it will give warning when thesoftware attempts something that hasn't been implemented.But even with this limitation, it seems that Mini vMacis of some use for this project.</p><p><a name="n160904"> <b>September 4, 2016</b> </a>- <a href="nva5.html#n160904">permanent link</a></p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshothas some further work on the SDL 2.0 port. Like most other ports,it can now use the ROM image at a central location, looking in afolder named &ldquo;mnvm_rom&rdquo; in the folder thatSDL_GetPrefPath returns. What SDL_GetPrefPath returns dependson the platform, on OS X it returns&ldquo;~/Library/Application Support/gryphel/minivmac&rdquo;.(Not that SDL for OS X really matters for Mini vMac,since a native port already exists. All the work with SDLis to help port Mini vMac to new platforms.)</p><p>Also added to the SDL 2.0 port is the option to let SDL handlescaling (for drawing in Magnify Mode), rather than code in Mini vMac.So whichever version works better can be chosen when using the SDL portto make a more native port of Mini vMac for a particular platform.</p><p>Recently I had allowed the Macintosh II emulation toboot in color, since it seemed to work now.

This is aMacintosh prototype that has a Twiggy floppy drive(used in the original Lisa computer), instead of the Sonydrive that the Macintosh 128K ended up shipping with.Except for the disk driver, the ROMs are nearly identical,except most everything is shifted to somewhat differentaddresses. Probably because the trap patching technique used inMacintosh System Software tends to depend on exact locationsof routines in ROM, no System Software that shipped willrun with the Twiggy ROM. There are two known disk imagesthat will work with it, one with an early version ofMacWrite and one with an early version of MacPaint.However these image don't currently work as is inthe Twiggy Mac emulation. Mat&#283;j Hybler figured out asmall patch to their boot block code to make them work,that disables some sort of check for the disk being bootable.This might be needed because the emulation is still usinga replacement disk driver that is trying to imitate thedata structures in memory used  by theSony disk driver, while the Twiggy disk driver hassignificantly different data structures.

(Soon after,the color mode is changed to the value saved ondisk.)
