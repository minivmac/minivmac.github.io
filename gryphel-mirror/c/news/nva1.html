Previously,the platform dependent code would tell the platformindependent code every emulated sixtieth of a second thecurrent mouse position and up/down state of the mousebutton and keys. If the host computer was very busy, or justslow, then a down and up pair could end up being processedin the same emulated sixtieth, and they would cancel eachother out and be lost entirely. Also a mouse buttonstate change might not be processed until well afterit happened, and the mouse position might be differentby then. (Though if Mini vMac is not getting timeevery sixtieth of a second, so that these problemscan be observed, then sound emulation isn't likely towork either, emitting horrible noises. But it ispossible to compile Mini vMac without sound.)And also if the host computer is a device withouta keyboard, such as using handwriting recognition, thenthere might not be separate key down and key up. </p><p> The X version now uses mouse motion events whenpossible instead of XQueryPointer, which is allegedto be inefficient. (Especially if the program isusing the display on another computer, so thatXQueryPointer requires a round trip over thenetwork. I've never tried this. I don't knowif anyone has.) </p><p> The Macintosh SE emulation, in full screen mode, willnow emulate the ADB protocol for mouse movement, insteadof just poking the changes into emulated low memory.This turned up a bug where apparently emulated ADBdevices were responding to commands too quickly,before the emulated Mac was ready. I increasedthe constant that specifies the delay. </p><p><a name="n071210"> <b>December 10, 2007</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n071210">permanent link</a></p><p> You can now increase the priority of features that you wantadded to Mini vMac, and support their development, bypledging bounties.

Not too big a change, but it involveda major project to identify the bugs. The 68020 emulation is probablynow accurate enough to emulate a Mac II. But this isn't too usefulyet, as Mini vMac doesn't emulate a Mac II, and almost no software thatrequires a 68020 doesn't also a require color quickdraw. </p><p><a name="n071201"> <b>December 1, 2007</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n071201">permanent link</a></p><p> I've decided to try to make development of Mini vMac 3.1 a bit more open thanin previous versions.  The <a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> pagehas source code snapshots of the work in progress. There is no promise thatit works correctly. Most people should wait for the first alpha, at least. </p><p> The main feature of today's snapshot is a hack to support larger screen sizes,with the <a href="../minivmac/build.html">build system</a> options '-hres' and '-vres'.For example '-hres 640 -vres 512' makes the emulated screen take aquarter of my lcd monitor, so it uses the entire monitor in full screenmagnify mode. Be warned this is very much a hack, involving numerousROM patches (and somewhat different patches on the Mac Plus, theMac SE, and the Mac 128/512). It emulates a computer that never existed,so there will definitely be compatibility issues with some software.Also keep in mind that most games that will work on the Mac Plusare designed for 512x342, and don't benefit from a larger screen.(The original vMac supported larger screen sizes also, with relatedmethod that doesn't directly work in Mini vMac.) </p><p> You can also set the emulated screen smaller than 512x342, which couldbe useful on portable devices, but that will really cause compatibilityissues. </p><p> Another change is that the alternate CPU emulation of Mini vMac 3.0.4 is nowthe main and only emulation. More testing is needed to become confident aboutit. The PowerPC assembly code version has been revised to match thenew emulation. Also the build system now generates this assembly codefor the selected development environment, instead of keeping separatecopies of this source for the two previously supported environments.This made it possible to also support using assembly codein PowerPC linux, with a new build system target, '-t lppc'.(Which about doubles the speed.) This so far has onlybeen tested in Ubuntu 6.06. </p><p> In response to this<a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1819362&amp;group_id=21744&amp;atid=372750">patch</a>,I've tried to start cleaning up type definitions so as to be better able towork on non 32 bit CPUs. </p><p> I've merged in changes from Fabio Concas's Pocket PC port version 2.8.2,and used a suggestion by Yuhong Bao to use _tWinMain instead of WinMainin the Windows version. </p><p> The build system now supports using the command line tools of theLCC compiler ('-e lcc -cl'), supports the Sun c compiler ('-e snc'),and supports compiling the Pocket PC version withMicrosoft Embedded Visual C++ 4 for ARM and the emulator('-t wcar' and '-t wc86'). </p><p><a name="n071115"> <b>November 15, 2007</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n071115">permanent link</a></p><p> Mini vMac 3.0.4 is now officially released (with no change from thefinal beta, as usual). New since the previous official release,2.8.2, is support for importing and exporting the clipboard and files,a new build system, localized versions for Dutch and Spanish, andmore. Also there are some bug fixes, such as that the PowerPCversion now works in Mac OS X 10.5.

Beta means no newfeatures will be added before the official release,which will hopefully be soon.Many more features could be added, but it has beentoo long since the last official release. </p><p> There aren&rsquo;t too many changes in the defaultcompile since the last alpha. The main one beingthat by default, the Macintosh versions ofMini vMac will not claim ownership to disk image andROM image files. So double clicking on disk imageswill not launch Mini vMac. This is because whenyou have lots of copies of Mini vMac around,all of which claim ownership of disk images,it is unpredictable what happens when youdouble click on one, making the feature useless.Instead there is a compile time option,<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_im">-im 1</a>,to make Mini vMac claim ownership as hasbeen done previously. You can then make sureto have only one copy of Mini vMac compiledthis way on your computer. </p><p> The Windows version also will now claim toown disk image and ROM image files whencompiled with '-im 1'. This feature had beenremoved from Mini vMac as of version 1.0,to avoid potential conflicts with otherprograms. </p><p> The Windows and Linux version will nowattempt to do character set translationwhen importing and exporting the clipboard,and for the names of imported and exportedfiles.

Before I had wanted to makeit quick to type, but now I think it is more importantto prevent hitting it accidentally. </p><p> Another change is that the variation name displayedin the about message, and used for file names,no longer includes the development environmentused to compile it or the debug status, but onlyhas the program name abbreviation, theversion number, and the target. Such asminivmac-3.0.2-imch, for the Intel Macintoshversion of Mini vMac 3.0.2. </p><p> When switching back to the Mini vMac application,previous versions would always ignore keysthat were already held down. There is nowa special case such that immediately aftera drag and drop on Mini vMac, it will not ignorekeys already held down. This makes it easierto rebuild the desktop of disk images byholding down command and option. However,the keys that map to command and option canhave special meanings in other operating systems.(For example, in OS X, clicking on the windowof another application with command and optiondown will hide all other applications.) Soit usually works better to press command-optionright before dropping, instead of before dragging.(Thanks to a complaint by<a href="http://woodwynlane.com/">David Sibley</a>for this feature.) </p><p> An obscure change is that when entering thecontrol mode, or the open dialog, or switchingto another application, all the emulatedkeys (except for caps lock) are releasedimmediately, instead of waiting untilnormal emulation resumes. An even moreobscure change is that in the control mode,changes to the caps lock key take effectimmediately, instead of waiting until leavingthe control mode. </p><p> There is now a compile time option,&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_ccs">-ccs</a>&rdquo;,to swap the emulated Control and Command keys.And there is an experimental option,&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_akm">-akm</a>&rdquo;,for making some keys more convenient to use. </p><p> The build system now supports more<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_ev">versions</a>of Xcode. (Thanks to complaints from David Mullin.) </p><p> The build system now includes<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_t">targets</a>for Solaris, for use by Luc Pauwels<a href="http://luc.xalasys.com/mac/minivmac.html">port</a>.So far the only change tothe generated source from the linux target is to includethe 'posix4' library. (And also the different target meansthe variation name, used in the about message, is different.) </p><p> The build system now has an option,&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_pk">-pk</a>&rdquo;,to package the compiled application in a formatsuitable for distribution. </p><p> The biggest bug fixed in this version is that in OS X theclock could be off by some hours because the time zonewasn&rsquo;t taken into account correctly. This happened becauseI was recently updating the OS X specific code toremove deprecated calls, which now seems to have beena waste, since now it seems the entire carbon APIis basically deprecated. </p><p> Another bug fixed in OS X, and also earlier Mac OS, isthat dragging and dropping onto the open file dialogwould also immediately try to mount that file inMini vMac. </p><p> A call to XFlush was missing in the X version (such asthe linux port), and the most noticeable effect wasthe lack of drawing when Mini vMac was in thebackground with the run in background option on. </p><p> The Windows and X versions now support thePageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Help/Ins, andForwardDelete keys. </p><p> An obscure bug fixed is that the mouse positioncould shift slightly when leaving fullscreen mode (or entering the open dialogin full screen mode). A more obscure bugfixed in the Macintosh versions is that {mouse down,control-o, mouse up, type escape key} wouldleave the emulated mouse stuck down. </p><p><a name="n070726"> <b>July 26, 2007</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n070726">permanent link</a></p><p> I&rsquo;m back from traveling and have released new versionsof <a href="../minivmac/extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>,<a href="../minivmac/extras/importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>,and <a href="../minivmac/extras/binunpk/index.html">binUnpk</a>. </p><p> ExportFl and ImportFl will now quit when told toon shutdown, and now check that the neededMini vMac extensions are available.

The new build system is designed to makethis more practical, to make it easier for people tocompile a custom version. </p><p> The build system is now a Macintosh program that runs inMini vMac (it would also work on a real 680x0 Macintosh).After you specify the options, the program generates anarchive containing all the files needed to compile Mini vMacwith those options in the selected developmentenvironment.

But lately, on gettingback to looking at this, I feel the currentform isn't appropriate for Mini vMac. Itmay be powerful and easy to use, but itfails to be simple and maintainable. AndI think I have a better idea, which can bebased of the current code. But this will needto wait for a future version, andso I'm releasing Mini vMac 2.8.2 now. </p><p> Pierre Lemieux provided the French translation of the program strings.Ga&euml;l Coup&eacute; assisted by proofreading (an earlier version).Pierre Lemieux has also translated much of the Mini vMac documentation,available on his website at<a href="http://pages.videotron.com/plemieux/minivmac/">http://pages.videotron.com/plemieux/minivmac/</a>.</p><p> Fabio Concas and Gianluca Abbiati provided the Italian translation.(Fabio Concas has previously ported Mini vMac to Pocket PC,available on his website at<a href="http://digilander.libero.it/jpdefault/mvm_index.html">http://digilander.libero.it/jpdefault/mvm_index.html</a>.)</p><p> Detlef Kahner provided the German translation. (He maintains thewebsite<a href="http://www.classics-for-x.info/">Classics For X</a>.) </p><p> The localizations are a compile time option. Now that the work has beendone on Mini vMac to support French, Italian, and German, it wouldn't be toohard to support other languages, that use a similar character set, if anyonewants to volunteer to provide translations. See the<a href="../minivmac/local/index.html">Localization Page</a> and the<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=529309">Localization Forum</a>.</p><p> Mini vMac now has a 'Stopped' mode as an on/off toggle, insteadof stopped being one of the set of speeds. So you can stop theemulation and then resume it, without having to remember whatspeed you were running. The implementation of Stopped modeis improved; the emulation is truly stopped, which fixesa potential issue with spurious sounds. The native cursorof the real machine is now shown while in stopped mode. </p><p> The ROM not found message now tells the name of the fileit is looking for. There were many reports that indicatedthis was needed. It also gives a web page addressfor further information. </p><p> This message, and other error messages and informationalmessages are now displayed using platform independent code similarto the control mode. This improves the X version, which previouslywould just write messages to stderr or stdout, which could easilybe missed, or be lost entirely depending on how the programwas launched. It also means the non ascii characters (such asaccented characters used in the French and Italian translations)are displayed more reliably across all versions. </p><p> If the ROM isn't found the program now doesn't immediatelyquit, but enters the stopped mode. This allows theerror message to be seen using the new display method. </p><p> A number of other error messages have been added or improved.If the ROM file is too short, Mini vMac gives an errorsaying so, and a different error if there was a some otherproblem reading the ROM.In the X and Windows versions, if it doesn't recognize acommand line argument, it will give a warning. </p><p> There are numerous refinements to the user interface strings,many of which were suggested by Pierre Lemieux. </p><p> The Windows version should now work better when the real computerisn't fast enough to emulate at 1x speed, allowing otherprograms and the computer as a whole to remain responsive. </p><p> In the Windows version the function keys F3 through F12 arenow passed through to the emulated machine, to match theMac and Linux versions. (F1 and F2 are used for the optionand command keys.) </p><p> In the X version, the open command has been removed, insteadof having a command that just gives a message saying not implemented(because an 'open a file' dialog isn't part of basic X).This is possible because of the more flexible way of displayingthe help screen which was needed for the French and Italianlocalizations. </p><p> In the X version, switching between normal mode and Magnifymode and Full Screen Mode may now work more reliably onmore operating systems, though it may sometimes flickera bit more. </p><p><a name="n060726"> <b>July 26, 2006</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n060726">permanent link</a></p><p>&ldquo;<a href="http://lazyone.drunkencoders.com/wordpress/">Lazyone</a>&rdquo;has released a Test/Alpha version of his port of Mini vMac to the Nintendo DS.</p><p><a name="n060722"> <b>July 22, 2006</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n060722">permanent link</a></p><p>&ldquo;Lazyone&rdquo; is making progress portingMini vMac to the Nintendo DS.

(There isno change from the beta.)Mini vMac now has more advanced control of speed, supersedingthe previous 'limit speed' option. Other highlights arean experimental compile time option for sound in the Linux version(thanks to Stephan Kochen), and that the Windows version is up to 40percent faster by simply using a better c compiler.</p><p> Here are the rest of the release notes, copiedfrom the beta page: </p><p> I've lately had the opportunity to test Mini vMac on a 2.7GHz PowerMac G5. (While doing other work for the company Scientific Imaging.The use of this machine and other help made Mini vMac 2.7.0possible.) Mini vMac 2.6.1 was not really usable on the G5,the moment it ran the fans would go wild. I've had previous reportsof such problems (such as from Ryan Schmidt), but I couldn't fix itwithout a machine to test solutions on. </p><p> The first change is that when 'limit speed' is on, Mini vMac willno longer try to monopolize the processor. I hadn't done this beforebecause Mini vMac needs time each and every 60th of a second forsmooth emulation, especially of sound, and I wasn't sure thatoperating systems could slice up time that fine. But aftera bit of experimentation it now seems to work adequately inMac OS X, Windows, Linux, and even Mac OS 9. It can actually besmoother because some operating systems will penalize programsfor trying to take all the processor time. </p><p> The next change is to replace the simple 'limit speed' togglewith a bigger range of choices: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, and "Allout". The 'L' command of the Control Mode is replaced with an 'S'command, that leads to another screen with more options. (The'Limit Speed' toggle is also removed from the menu bar, in Macintoshand Windows.) So you can choose how fast you want the emulatedmachine to run, and thereby what percentage of the processor totake. I had previously thought that perhaps Mini vMaccould automatically try to detect when the emulated machine isidle and slow down if it is. But there is no rightway of doing this, there could only be guesses that would oftenbe wrong. And it turns out that even if this could be done correctly,I still wouldn't like the result on a Power Mac G5 (running OS X10.4.2). Within less than a second of the processor usage reaching100 percent, the fans speed up. I can't think of any way toautomatically guess that the emulated machine is idle much faster thanthat. By making the speed control manual, the fans stay constantno matter what the emulated machine is doing. This isn't just a problemfor Mini vMac, it is a problem for any software not carefully writtenwith the issue in mind. (For example, dragging a scroll bar inMozilla 1.7.8 turns on the fans.) Hopefully, future versions ofMac OS X will improve the fan control. I think running the fansa bit louder always would be preferable than to having them alwayschanging. </p><p> Since Mini vMac no longer needs to monopolize the processorthere is now an option to allow it keep running even whenit is not the active window. This is toggled by the 'B'command of the Speed Control screen. So you can set some computationgoing in Mini vMac and then use other programs on your machine.You can even have two copies of Mini vMac running at once. (Notethat this is probably not legal unless you own a real Macintoshfor each virtual machine running at once.) You can set MinivMac to run in the background with the speed set to "All out",but this isn't recommended, except on a dual processor machine(Mini vMac can only use one processor). </p><p> There is now a command to stop Mini vMac (when it's the activeapplication), the 'S' command of the Speed Control screen. Thiscan be convenient, such as to pause a game. The implementationisn't yet satisfactory. The emulation needs to keep partiallyrunning so the Control Mode will work, which can result in somespurious sound output. I'll try to fix this in a later version. </p><p> Mini vMac will by default start at 8x speed, fast enough to feelreasonably snappy, but not so fast as to stress modern machines(which can go up to 20x to 50x). The '/l' command line optionof the Windows version, and the '-l' command line optionof the X version, will still work, causing Mini vMac to startat 1x speed. </p><p> The minimum emulation speed is now 1x instead of 0.5x, to reducepossible compatibility issues and to simplify the code. If thereal machine isn't fast enough to do 1x, the emulated machine willstill think it is running at the normal number of instructions pertime, but its sense of time will not match the real time. </p><p> The Control Mode help screen will now display the current speedsetting, and in addition will also display the Full Screen, Magnify,and emulated Control Key option settings. </p><p> The implementation of limiting speed is different for eachoperating system, and the behavior may vary a bit between them.In OS X, the emulation will now continue running (but only at 1x)while dragging the Mini vMac window, selecting from a menu, orwhile a dialog is up. In OS 9, the emulation will stop at allof these times. In other operating systems, the emulation maystop at some these times.In Mac OS 9, which uses cooperative multitasking, MinivMac will only run smoothly if all other running programsare very cooperative. </p><p> I had thought that modern compilers couldn't cope very well withan emulation loop. But it turns out that the compiler in the free "Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003" does pretty well, betterthan the very old Microsoft compiler that I previously used.This speeds up the Windows version by up to 40 percent. (TheOS X version uses hand tweaked PPC assembly, originally basedfrom the output of the MrC compiler.) </p><p> Mini vMac now includes the patch from Stephan Kochen thatadds support for sound in the Linux version using ALSA. UnfortunatelyI haven't been able to test the merged version, since I haven't gottensound to work at all in any version of Linux running in virtual PC.I did try installing one version of Linux (Ubuntu) on a real PC,where sound worked, but the very first call in Mini vMac that opensthe audio device fails saying busy. Perhaps I didn't get the ALSAdevelopment files installed correctly. I made a number changes fromthe original patch to match Mini vMac formatting and error handlingconventions, and to try to make it use non blocking, so I'm not sureif the current source would actually work at all on any machine.So I've not enabled it by default, it is a compile time option.[update: Stephan Kochen reports that it works for him. Therewas also one report of it not working.] </p><p> However, compiling with sound enabled in the Linux version involvesmore than just adding a line to the CNFGGLOB.h file. It needs anadditional file header and library file. To deal with options likethis I have added to the build system. There is now a collectionof simple scripts, for various scripting languages, that takeoptional command line arguments and compile "setup.c" and use theresult to compile Mini vMac. Unfortunately this isn't documentedyet, so for 2.7.0 I've still generated the "projects" folder,which can be used as in the previous version. But for now I can saythat to compile the Linux version with sound, open a terminal windowand change the current directory to the 'source' folder.Then type 'bash build/bash MySoundEnabled' (and press return).When it finishes, there should now be a program called 'minivmac'in the 'output' folder, created within the 'source' folder. (Or you can use 'bash build/bash MySoundEnabled -keepmake', whichwill keep the make file, so that you can make changes and recompile.) </p><p> In the Mac OS X version, if you create a folder called "mnvm_dat"inside the "Contents" folder within the application bundle(control click on the application and choose "Show Package Contents"),then Mini vMac will look for the "vMac.ROM" file, and thedisk1.dsk, disk2.dsk, etc files within the "mnvm_dat" folder.This allows you to make a self contained Mac OS X application thatruns an application for the Mac Plus (especially when used withthe AutoQuit software.) </p><p> In the Mac and Windows versions, the name of the Mini vMac windowwill be taken from the name of the application file, instead ofjust being "Mini vMac". So you can change the application nameto change the window name, which also affects things like the Dock(OS X) or the Taskbar (Windows). </p><p> Mini vMac can now when launched automatically mount more than justthree disks. It can also mount "disk4.dsk", "disk5.dsk", up to"disk9.dsk" (If Mini vMac is recompiled to support that many diskimages. The default is 6, the maximum is 32). </p><p> The Windows version now supports "Shortcut" files (The Windowsequivalent to Macintosh "Aliases".) The "vMac.ROM" and the "disk1.dsk","disk2.dsk", etc files may be Shortcuts. It must be "vMac.ROM",not "Shortcut to vMac.ROM". Actually, the file is really named"vMac.ROM.lnk", but what you see is "vMac.ROM". </p><p> The Macintosh version now supports drag and drop of aliases. Itis simply a bug that it didn't previously work. </p><p> The Macintosh OS X version now uses the recommended SetSystemUIModeto enter Full Screen mode when it is available (10.2 or later).The main noticeable difference is that Command-Tab is no longerintercepted by the operating system, but passed to the emulatedmachine. (The intended only way to exit Full Screen mode is totype "Control-F".) </p><p> The "About" command of the Control Mode ("A") no longer displayscopyright holders, since the complete list is too long tofit here. It now only displays the maintainer name, immediatelyfollowed by the web page, where the complete list can befound (on the<a href="../minivmac/credits.html">Credits</a>page). Anyone maintaining a fork of Mini vMac (such asFabio Concas) can change kMaintainerName and kStrHomePagein "setup.h". </p><p> Mini vMac now has some code for 68020 emulation as a compiletime option. (The Mac Plus ROM supports the 68020, and vMac forMacintosh emulates a 68020 instead of a 68000.) Much of theimplementation is adapted from the "UAE Amiga Emulator", mostlyas found in the vMac source. The Mini vMac 68020 emulation workswell enough to boot up with the emulated machine thinking ithas a 68020, with the operating system and MacsBug workingcorrectly, and most software that doesn't require a 68020 workingnormally. It is hard to test the 68020 emulation because mostsoftware that requires the 68020 also requires color quickdraw.The little software I've found that seems like it ought to workall crashes, so I'm pretty sure there are bugs in this 68020emulation. The main reason for emulating a Mac Plus 68020is as a stepping stone to emulating the Mac II. Having theMac Plus 68020 working as well as it does so far will make iteasier to write testing software to make a correct 68020implementation. </p><p> This were some bugs in the VIA timer 1 emulation and the delayedtask mechanism. Fixing these allows Mini vMac to pass the testsof Apple's MacCheck program when running faster than 1x(2.6.1 would pass only if 'Limit Speed' was on). </p><p> There was a bug in the PPC asm version of the 68000 emulator,where a routine wasn't preserving all registers it should. Thisdoesn't seem to affect previous versions of Mini vMac, but itdefinitely affected the current version. </p><p> The 680x0 emulator emulated the Fline trap incorrectly. Thisdoesn't previously seem to have had any effect, but it preventedMacsBug from working with the 68020 emulation. </p><p> The MoveS instruction has been removed from 68000 emulation, sinceit isn't a legal 68000 instruction. Also the implementationwasn't correct anyway. A possibly correct version is now inthe 68020 emulation. </p><p> Mini vMac for OS 9 and earlier (PPC) will now work back toOS 8.1. It should work in earlier versions of Mac OS, but Ihaven't tested this yet. (Mini vMac for Macintosh 680x0seems to work back to System 2, though it's not too thoroughlytested.) </p><p><a name="n051010"> <b>October 10, 2005</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n051010">permanent link</a></p><p>The<a href="../minivmac/beta.html">public beta</a>of version 2.7.1 is available.</p><p><a name="n050801"> <b>August 1, 2005</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n050801">permanent link</a></p><p>The first<a href="../minivmac/beta.html">public beta</a>of version 2.7.0 is available.</p><p><a name="n050525"> <b>May 25, 2005</b> </a>- <a href="nva1.html#n050525">permanent link</a></p><p>I'm getting back to Mini vMac development, after some weeks oftravelling.Meanwhile, Stephan Kochen has implemented sound in the Linuxversion, using ALSA.
