Instead, options can be chosenat compile time. You can compile a variation of Mini vMacwith options you desire following the instructions on the<a href="build.html">Build</a>page. </p><p>Or, the Variations Service can compile variations for you in seconds.</p><p>With a&ldquo;<a href="sp_code.html">Subscriber Code</a>&rdquo;,you can easily create custom variations, as many as youcould reasonably want for a period of a year. Youcan make as many copies of these variations as you want,and give them to anyone, under the GNU General Public License (GPL).A Subscriber Code can be purchased for ten dollars, which helps tosupport the operation of the Gryphel Project.</p><p>Without a Subscriber Code, you can request Demo versions, thatare identical to the regular version,except that the word &ldquo;Demo&rdquo; floats around the emulatedscreen.</p><a href="../../index.html"><img src="../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><h4> Directions </h4><p> Select the options you desire from the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service (Intro)</a>page, including your Subscriber Code if you have one, thenpress the &ldquo;Make custom variation&rdquo; button at top.</p> <p>In around 5 seconds, a page will appear with a download link.Click on the link to download your compiled variation. (Andyou should also save the &ldquo;info&rdquo; file, which allowsyou to verify the integrity of the download.)</p><p>Meanwhile, the Variation Server has been double checking,by compiling the variation a second time. If you reloadthe page with your web browser (another 5 seconds or soafter the page first appears), a line at the bottom thatsaid &ldquo;Preliminary Result&rdquo; should change to&ldquo;Final Result (both compiles match)&rdquo;. Otherwise,an error will be displayed.</p><p> After you download the variation,extract the application from the archive, and place theappropriate ROM image file into the same folder,just as is done for the  standard compile of Mini vMac.Mini vMac does not create preference files or change registry settingsor make any other changes to your computer. So there is no problem inhaving multiple variations of Mini vMac installed.</p><h4> Additional details </h4><p>The only required option is the target platform(&ldquo;Your computer runs&rdquo;). If you also give a Subscriber Code,but change nothing else on the page, the resulting application will beidentical to one of the<a href="dnld_std.html">Standard Variations</a>.</p><p>By default, the Variations Service compiles the current stable<a href="branch.html">branch</a>of Mini vMac. If you want to compile an alpha, beta, or old variation,select that from the Branch pop up menu.</p><p>The Intro Variations Service offers only afew options. Many more options are available, see the<a href="var_srvi.html">Variations Service Index</a>.</p><p>To prevent taking too much space on my hosting provider&rsquo;scomputers, older custom variations will eventually be removed.So please download your variation promptly.</p><p>The Variations Service is reproducible.That is, if you ask for the same optionstwice, you will get the exact same application archive. (Thefile name will be different, but the contents are the same.)The Subscriber Code used does not effect theresulting variation, so two subscribers requesting the samevariation will get the same result. (With no Subscriber Code, ademo is created, which is different from the regularvariation.)</p><h4> Some fine print </h4><p>The Variations Service only promises to build variationsaccurately from the public Mini vMac source. No guarantee is madethat the built variations are suitable for any purpose.(Please <a href="../feedback.html">report any bugs</a>.)It is possible that some variations can not be built at all due tobugs in the Mini vMac source. Otherwise, requested variations will bebuilt eventually, but there is no guarantee of how long it will take,due to hardware failures and such issues. </p><p> : </p><p> Back to - <b><a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service (Intro)</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/var_dir- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
