It should also work on many other 680x0 Macintoshmodels, but most haven't been tested. CopyRoms should beable run without crashing on any Macintosh,even if it doesn't succeed in saving a ROM image.</p><p>To use, just launch the CopyRoms application. Itshould write out a file (to the folder containingthe application) and then immediately quit.On a Macintosh Plus, or Macintosh 512Ke, it shouldwrite out a 128K file called "vMac.ROM".For the name and size of the file written out onsome other machines see this list of<a href="../../../mac68k/index.html">Macintosh 680x0</a>models. CopyRoms only works on computers witha ROM whose checksum is included in this list.</p><p>If CopyRoms writes out a zero byte file, that most likelymeans there wasn&rsquo;t enough free disk space to write the ROMimage. (See the<a href="../../../mac68k/index.html">Macintosh 680x0</a>list for the required size.)</p><p>If CopyRoms doesn't recognize the ROM, it willwrite out a 4 byte file called 'Unknown.ROM',containing just the checksum from the start ofthe ROM. Please send<a href="../../../feedback.html">me</a>this 4 byte file, along with a description of your computer,so that I can support it in a future version of CopyRoms.(But only if you are using a 680x0 Macintosh,not PowerPC or Intel.)(And don't send me actual ROM image files.)</p><p>CopyRoms has no user interface, and so can be used evenon a machine without a working keyboard, mouse,and/or screen. This can be done by preparing afloppy disk with CopyRoms set to be the startupapplication (in System 6 or earlier, not System 7),and replacing the finder with the"<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>"application. Make sure there isenough free disk space for the ROM image file.</p><p>The main difficulty in using CopyRoms is transferringthe program to the old Macintosh, and transferringthe acquired ROM image to another machine.Modern Macintoshes can't use the 800Kfloppy disks used by the Mac Plus. The easiestsolution is to use a slightly less old Macintoshthat can use 800k disks, and that has ethernetor other communication options to talk tomore recent machines. Some otherpossibilities are an AppleTalk/Ethernetconverter, an external SCSI drive (though modernMacs can't use external SCSI drives without 3rd partyhardware), a null modem cable, or connectingto the internet with a modem.The Macintosh 128K and 512K are even more difficult,since they only understand 400k MFS floppies,and don't have a SCSI port. It is easiestif you also have a Mac Plus.</p><p>The ROM image files that CopyRoms saves arecopyright Apple Computer, and may not beredistributed.</p><p>See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling CopyRoms from the source code.</p><p> <a name="alpha"> <b>Alpha version</b> in development </a> </p><p>The binary of the Alpha version is so far identical to the stableversion above, but the source code is different, being portedto <a href="../reasm/index.html">ReAsm</a>.</p><p> Download Alpha </p><blockquote><p><a href="../../../../d/minivmac/extras/copyroms/copyroms-191201.zip">copyroms-191201.zip</a>(<a href="../../../../d/minivmac/extras/copyroms/copyroms-191201.inf.txt">info</a>)a zipped hfs disk image and checksum file.The disk image can be mounted with Mini vMac.Includes source code.</p></blockquote><p> You can redistribute CopyRoms and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
