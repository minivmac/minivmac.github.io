However, if you don&rsquo;t require theextra features of AutQuit7, and do require System 7.5,EjctQuit may still be useful. Since EjctQuit doesn&rsquo;trun until shut down, it doesn&rsquo;t have the (small) memoryusage of AutQuit7, or the (slight) chance ofincompatibilities. </p><p> All the application does is to set a flag within Mini vMac, whichcauses Mini vMac to quit when the last disk is ejected.So it will also work to place it in the "Startup Items" folderof earlier System 7 versions (which don&rsquo;t have a "Shutdown Items")folder, but the disadvantage is that Mini vMac will quit ifyou eject the startup disk, and no other disks are mounted. </p><p> EjctQuit is a variation of <a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>,with the code for shutting down the machine taken out, sincethe "Shut Down" command already takes care of that. It is alsoan ordinary application, rather than a file with the same typeas the Finder. </p><p> If the shift key is held down, EjctQuit will have no effect.(Mini vMac won&rsquo;t quit, so you can reset the emulated machineand mount another boot disk image.) </p><p> EjctQuit will check to make sure that it is runninginside of Mini vMac, and do nothing if it isn&rsquo;t.This means it is safe to use a disk image withEjctQuit installed in other emulators. </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling EjctQuit from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute EjctQuit and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
