Public and secretkey pairs for these tools can be created with<a href="../makekeys/index.html">MakeKeys</a>.</p><p> <img src="../../../../d/minivmac/extras/sigwrite/screen.gif" width=514 height=344 border=0 alt="Screenshot"> </p><p> To use SigWrite, launch the application, and in the editing windowthat appears, paste in a message to be signed. For example: </p><blockquote><pre>Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesdid gyre and gimble in the wabe:All mimsy were the borogoves,and the mome raths outgrabe.</pre></blockquote><p>Copy all of the indented text above. Then paste it into SigWrite,which requires getting the clipboard into the emulated Macintosh, ifSigWrite is run inside Mini vMac. You can gettext into the emulated Macintosh using the &ldquo;Host Paste&rdquo;command in the Edit Menu of SigWrite. It is like the &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command,except that it uses the clipboard of the real computer insteadof the clipboard of the emulated computer. The keyboard shortcutis Command-Option-V. (The &ldquo;Host Paste&rdquo; command hassimilar effect to using<a href="../clipin/index.html">ClipIn</a>and then the normal &ldquo;Paste&rdquo; command.)</p><p> Then click on the status bar, at the bottomof the window below the editing area.(Choosing the &lsquo;Go&rsquo; command from the File menu,of the emulated Macintosh, will also work. The keyboard shortcutis Command-G.) </p><p>The editing area is cleared. Next paste in a secret keyto sign the message with. (One can be created with<a href="../makekeys/index.html">MakeKeys</a>).For example (and only as example,normally a secret key should never be given to anyoneelse):</p><blockquote><pre>----- BEGIN GRY SECRET KEY -----Gry+SKAIAAA/AXuKqWsF8Rh5Ie4/vORBnTxYf8FPpRl/n6hpgDgfJ5MAOsAEyePEnSfjmL3I9emNTuW/iCIHlCl/WkaWyMQZ+NDb1ZsnSLyOKwOycVkR3JwJbUamM4wyjUuoWV6jzuhqWZobpGPMSN4B3ivHXtcNVm5SVmnAL13T4FCLnx+TxaYRAQAB9n9NyEapaUzZs3Pdv2zNzs77wWHev2/i0qAIFxBLWI5VvPd6NuXEefADAtAJHhzm9kozgWrLZ9pVF+D537ewv3/mZJPGS0u7Ino5F3AQ20NhDvX3JwovUSgUkmy59PbJgZ2M0zNCvKuephFJbT4Pgi2oc7ZT/qZagkNNDErbyLb7NvBAU6+Ezbb2ejBd0C7s5tM4Eu8DD8MJUOdZXctnyzF4F0Nz+TG+NtqN/0Ks8OGUCRysWLyciQ6iej7+vivHhLxrwPBA26XYQmRphwlwz6n+VNzd9huh29Ak12ZwgeNpkyO1LIdueVUu6f+sUJYx1HlgtkHwE6ax3jPN+5osKOQ8/0Pg3fY/8CwOIpqLB6QDLCtY2ZrfM69mWkw/QTyGNSDUFIkI5corJbgms5mGMGQ2CyEZZ3RjzDtP5YwVAdzd4oNdKLHsK+k4nA==------ END GRY SECRET KEY ------</pre></blockquote><p>Before continuing, it would be a good idea to set Mini vMac to<a href="../../hardware.html#processor">All Out speed</a>.Then, on a modern computer, SigWrite shouldtake less than ten seconds to run (for a 1024 bit key, asin this example).At 1x speed, or on a real Macintosh Plus, it takes much longer.The code of SigWrite is intended to be simpleto understand and maintain, as opposed to fast.</p><p>Again, click on the status bar. After a while, ifall is well, the edit area is replaced with the signed text:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------Twas brillig, and the slithy tovesdid gyre and gimble in the wabe:All mimsy were the borogoves,and the mome raths outgrabe.------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/AXuKqWsF8Rh5/Bb045yIowANlvp/V/ymKoDa55Wb7dW/xGfPmca8oLw+Rv9dcSQpcL+XpzESnWqpK/uNg7lTIe4wdOzo1/s6bHU0u27J+A5EngkYQiAMHeETq6NxDM8viQbkNx2UZrDxyOLCGXW1N4txMktyjC3DYzRMH/oKBVHxgP6B2j8sipEgp3Zf-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p>When SigWrite is run inside Mini vMac, you can gettext out of the emulated Macintosh using the &ldquo;Host Copy&rdquo;command in the Edit Menu. It is like the &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command,except that it uses the clipboard of the real computer insteadof the clipboard of the emulated computer. The keyboard shortcutis Command-Option-C. (The &ldquo;Host Copy&rdquo; command hassimilar effect to using the normal &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command and then<a href="../clipout/index.html">ClipOut</a>.)</p><p>SigWrite is in part descended from MacPGP source code, which, as far asI can tell, allows derived works for noncommercial use. <!-- SigWrite isgenerally compatible with MacPGP, but it is easier to legallydistribute, since it doesn&rsquo;t do cryptography. Since it only doesone thing it should also be easier to use. --></p><p><!--SigWrite only handles a subset of secret keys that MacPGP does.For one thing, it does not handle encrypted keys, which is whatMacPGP would normally generate.-->MacPGP has various code to tryto protect secrets from other software running on the computer.SigWrite does not, instead you should try to secure the entire virtualmachine that it is run in. Such as by putting the Mini vMac diskimage on an encrypted volume of the host computer, for a start.</p><p>If a file named &ldquo;sec_key.txt&rdquo; exists in thesame folder as the application, then SigWrite will not askfor the secret key, but instead get it from that file.So you can save time for a frequently used key by setting upa copy of SigWrite this way. You can save even more time by&ldquo;wrapping&rdquo; this copy of SigWrite with<a href="../autoquit/index.html">AutoQuit</a>.</p><p><a href="../sigwrttl/index.html">SigWrtTl</a>is a command line version of SigWrite.</p><p>SigWrite is a successor to<a href="../psgwrite/index.html">PSgWrite</a>,which uses a different format that is more or less compatiblewith MacPGP.</p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling SigWrite from the source code. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find SigWrite useful, please consider<a href="../../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../../index.html"><img src="../../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="../index.html">extras</a>/sigwrite- <a href="../../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
