(More specifically, one pixel wide barswith 7 pixels of space between bars, moving to the left at one pixelper tick, with about 60.15 ticks per second.) </p><p> For an emulator, this is about the worst possible case. It makesclearly visible any "tearing" effects cased by different screen refreshrates between the real and emulated computer. Also, if the operatingsystem doesn't give the emulator time to run very regularly,it is very noticeable. And also, the entire screen changes withevery tick, preventing the optimization where Mini vMac redrawsonly the part of the emulated screen that has changed, makingclear just how much processing power is needed for video. Old machinessuch as a 400 MHz G3 iMac running OS X don't have enough, and can'trun TestSync at even 1x speed. </p><p> TestSync continues running until you click the mouse or pressa key. TestSync will not work on a Macintosh with ColorQuickdraw, and should refuse to run. </p><p> TestSync exists thanks to Manuel Alfayate, who complained aboutgraphics tearing in Mini vMac. I didn't see anythinglike that, and I thought Apple documentation impliedit shouldn't happen in OS X 10.4 and later. Eventually I had the theory that it was just the software he was running,which perhaps would also tear on a real Mac Plus, or perhapssome inaccuracy of the emulation caused itto happen with this particular software. SoI created TestSync to prove thistheory, but instead it conclusively disproved it.The tearing was clearly visible, even though I had nevernoticed it before. </p><p> I haven't decided what to do about this yet, if anything.It would not generally be practical to sync theemulation and the real monitor. A Macintosh Plus screen has a specific refresh rate(about 60.15 times per second), and even modernmonitors that allow changing the refresh rate probablymostly can't match that exact value. And even ifit could be done, it would only make sense todo so in full screen mode, and changing therefresh rate would probably take a noticeableamount of time, and I like the current abilityof Mini vMac to enter and leave full screen modeinstantaneously.To prevent tearing without syncing would necessarily losea bit of smoothness, since a real or emulated frame mustoccasionally be skipped. This can be done in OS X usingthe AGL_DOUBLEBUFFER and AGL_SWAP_INTERVALoptions of OpenGL, but it is very expensive, andthere might be more efficient alternatives. </p><p> By the way, redrawing the entire screen 60.15times a second pushes the limits of what aMacintosh Plus can do. 21,888 bytes need tobe changed in about 10,000 instructions. Whichis why TestSync is written the way it is, withassembly language code writing directlyto the screen memory. </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling TestSync from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute TestSync and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
