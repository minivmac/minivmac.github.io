For example, dragging the icon of the file tobe imported into the Mini vMac window. </p><p> <b>warning:</b> When attempting to use ImportFl, if you see adialog asking if you want to initialize the disk, choose&ldquo;Eject&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Initialize&rdquo;!This will happen if ImportFl is notactually the active application, in which case the fileyou are attempting to import is treated as a disk image.Choosing &ldquo;Initialize&rdquo; will turn it into a valid disk image,destroying parts of the previous content. </p><p> ImportFl is mostly useful for importing archives, since it onlyimports the data fork of a file, not Macintosh specificinformation such as the resource fork, the file type, thefile creator, and comments.(In particular, applications are mostly contained inthe resource fork, and so can not be imported with ImportFl.And aside from OS X, most other modern operating systemsdon't support resource forks, and so can not correctlystore an old Macintosh application, and so there isnothing that ImportFl could import anyway.)</p><p>Since ImportFl doesn&rsquo;t receive Macintosh file typeand creator information from the real computer,it sets the file type of the imported file to&ldquo;BINA&rdquo; and the creator type to &ldquo;SITx&rdquo;.That creator type belongs to<a href="../../../sw/archive/stuffexp/index.html">Stuffit Expander</a>,which can deal with most archive types you would want to import.So double clicking on the imported file will launch Stuffit Expander,if it is available. If it is not available, double clicking onthe imported file will result in an error message. In System 6:&lsquo;The file &ldquo;&lt;file_name&gt;&rdquo; could not beopened/printed (the application is busy or missing).&rsquo;In System 7: &lsquo;The document &ldquo;&lt;file_name&gt;&rdquo; couldnot be opened, because the application program that created it couldnot be found.&rsquo;</p><p>Many old archives can be unpacked with<a href="../../../sw/archive/stuffexp/index.html">Stuffit Expander 4.0.1</a>.However, it is common to encounter a Stuffit file that requiresa more recent version of Stuffit Expander than will run ona Macintosh Plus. In that case, it will often work withStuffit Expander 5.5, available from the same page, running onthe Macintosh II emulation of Mini vMac. If an even later versionof Stuffit Expander is required, you could uncompress it on a differentMacintosh emulator, such as Basilisk II, or a real Macintosh.</p><p>If what you are importing is not an archive, you canfix the file type and file creator withutilities like<a href="../../../sw/sysutils/fndrinfo/index.html">Finder Info</a>or <a href="../../../sw/sysutils/crtrchng/index.html">Creator Changer</a>.This can be fine for text files (type &ldquo;TEXT&rdquo;) and someothers, but again, many other file types have information in theresource fork, which is not imported by ImportFl, and most operatingsystems besides OS X cannot store in the first place.</p><p>If you do have files on OS X that you want to import, the Finderapplication has the built in ability to create an archivethat preserves most Macintosh specific information.Right click (or click with the Control key down) onthe icon of a file or folder, and choose the"Compress" command. The archive is created inthe same folder with a name ending in ".zip".Once you import the file into Mini vMac with ImportFl, StuffIt Expanderwon&rsquo;t really properly deal with it.Such archives can be unpacked in Mini vMac with the<a href="../../../sw/archive/miniunzp/index.html">MiniUnZp</a>application, or using the more advanced<a href="http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=8322">miniunz</a>from Adam P.</p><p>Another alternative is that recent versions of OS X include a<a href="http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/macbinary.1.html">macbinary</a>command, which can be used from the Terminal to convert a fileinto into MacBinary format, which can be unpacked with<a href="../binunpk/index.html">binUnpk</a>or<a href="../../../sw/archive/stuffexp/index.html">Stuffit Expander</a>.(Thanks to Ryan Schmidt and Samir Namer forpointing out this command.)</p><p> If you would like to import plain text,<a href="../clipin/index.html">ClipIn</a> may be more convenient. </p><p> If you would like to export files, see<a href="../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>, the opposite of ImportFl. </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling ImportFl from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute ImportFl and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
