Mount the fdplusv3-191208 disk image, and importa copy of the Macintosh Plus ROM onto it. (Such as by using<a href="../../importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>.) Mount thefdisasm200105 disk image, copy the FDisasm applicationto the fdplus disk image, and then eject the fdisasmimage. Rename the ROM imageto &ldquo;bin&rdquo;, and then launch the FDisasm application. Theprogram displays a progress indicator, and quits whenit is finished. (It could take five minutes at 1x speed,so set speed to &ldquo;all out&rdquo;. At &ldquo;all out&rdquo; speed ittakes under 10 seconds to finish on my Mac Mini.) When the programfinishes, the output is in a file named &ldquo;listing&rdquo;.</p><p>This listing file is over 2 megabytes. The programMPW Shell 3.2.3 works in Mini vMac and can work with suchlarge text files. But probably almost nobody else has anold copy of MPW. (The final version of MPW still availablefor free download requires a Mac II or later.) Insteadyou can export the listing file to the host computer(such as by using <a href="../../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>),and find some program there that can view it. (ForOS X, TextWrangler would work, for example.)</p><p><b>Warning</b> : Not enough people are payingenough attention to FDisasm (especially me) forit to be relied upon. If you notice somethingodd in the output, double check it, and ifit is wrong, please report it to<a href="../../../../feedback.html">me</a>.</p><p>This listing file is derived (in terms of copyrightlaw) from the Macintosh Plus ROM, and so may not beredistributed.</p><p>To disassemble the Macintosh 128/512 ROM, follow the aboveinstructions, except use the fdmac128-0.3.0 disk image, andof course use a ROM image from a Macintosh 128 or 512.And similarly for the Macintosh SE, MacintoshII, and PowerBook 100 ROMs.</p><p>Here are some details about the formatting informationfiles used by FDisasm:</p><p>The only file required by FDisasm is &ldquo;bin&rdquo;. But if this isall it finds, it will just create a hexadecimal dump ofthe file. To disassemble code, it needs to know wherethe code is. It looks for a file named &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; forthis information. It also looks for a file named &ldquo;bin_names&rdquo;for names of locations within &ldquo;bin&rdquo;, and for a filenamed &ldquo;abs_names&rdquo; for names of absolute memory locations,and for a file named &ldquo;trap_names&rdquo; for names of A-lineinstructions. A file named &ldquo;format&rdquo; can give additionalformatting information, and comments to include in the listing.</p><p>The<a href="../../findcode/index.html">FindCode</a>tool can help to create the files &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; and&ldquo;bin_names&rdquo;.</p><p>The<a href="../../findres/index.html">FindRes</a>tool will createan initial &ldquo;format&rdquo; file for Macintosh resources, andalso &ldquo;bin_map&rdquo; and a set of entry points to feedto FindCode.</p><p>Besides ROM images, FDisasm can also disassembleMacintosh 680x0 applications. But the code and otherresources are located in the &ldquo;resource fork&rdquo; of suchappplications, while FDisasm only operateson the &ldquo;data fork&rdquo; of the file &ldquo;bin&rdquo;.The <a href="../../getrsfrk/index.html">GetRsFrk</a> tool getsthe resource fork of a file you select, and savesit into the data fork of &ldquo;bin&rdquo;.An alternative is<a href="../../aspack/index.html">asPack</a>,which also saves the data fork and the meta data into &ldquo;bin&rdquo;,in AppleSingle format.</p><p>FDisasm has some compile time options. The default values aredefined in &ldquo;source/CNFGDLFT.i&rdquo;, and these defaultscan be changed in &ldquo;source/CONFIGUR.i&rdquo;. For example,the following variation outputs address and hexfields, resulting in output that is not suitable for passing to anassembler, but is more useful when working on the format file.</p><p> Download </p><blockquote><p><a href="../../../../../d/minivmac/extras/fdisasm/a/fdis0003-200105.zip">fdis0003-200105.zip</a>(<a href="../../../../../d/minivmac/extras/fdisasm/a/fdis0003-200105.inf.txt">info</a>)variation of FDisasm.</p></blockquote><p>The software that has become FDisasm, FindCode, andFindRes was my first serious programmingproject, started in 1985 in Basic, and later convertedto Pascal, and now converted to C when I got back toit recently.
