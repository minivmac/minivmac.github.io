Includes source code.</p><p> <b>latest update : obsolete !!</b> -It is now recommended to use <a href="../importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a> and<a href="../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>for transfering files to and from the real computer, instead of tryingto do so by mounting a disk image on the real computer.</p><p> <b>update</b> - SetFType may not be effective on modern versions of OS X, particularlyon an Intel Macintosh. It also may not be needed. Instead, rename a diskimage so that the name ends with '.dmg' to be able to mount it on thereal computer. Make the name end with '.dsk' to make the disk image belongto Mini vMac. (But as of version 3.0.4, only a copy ofMini vMac compiled with the '<a href="../../options.html#option_im">-im 1</a>'option.) </p></blockquote><p> SetFType has two variations.Both are utilities for Mac OS X and OS 9 thatset the file type and creator of disk image files. </p><p> "SetFType.dimg" makes the file belong to Disk Copy,which makes it possible to mount the disk imageon the real machine (such as by double clickingon it). Mounting a disk image on the real machineallows you to transfer files to and from the emulatedmachine, as described in more detail on the<a href="../../../image/index.html">Disk Image</a>page. </p><p> "SetFType.MvIm" makes the file belong to Mini vMac,so that double clicking on the file will mountthe disk image within the emulator. This can beconvenient, but it is not required, since Mini vMaccan open a disk image file of any type, using theopen command, or drag and drop onto the applicationwindow or icon. </p><p> To use SetFType, drag the icon of a disk imagefile onto one of the two applications("SetFType.MvIm" or "SetFType.dimg").The program will set the file type and creatorof the disk image, put up a dialog to tell youit worked, and then quit.The program does a simple check to see if thefile is really a disk image (of the kinds thatMini vMac can mount), and displays an error messageif it isn't.You can drag more than one file onto theapplication icon. The program will processall of them. </p><p> If you are using Mac OS 9 and SetFType will notaccept a drag and drop (doesn't highlight), tryrebuilding the desktop. That is, restart the computerand hold down the option and command (apple) keys. </p><p> Note: you should avoid mounting a bootable diskon your real machine, since this may make itunbootable, for some combinations of operatingsystems on the real machine and the disk image. </p><p> You can redistribute SetFType and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
