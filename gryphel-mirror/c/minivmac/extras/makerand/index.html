Random data is gathered from the timing of your key presses. Thetext you type is also mixed in.</p><p>MakeRand counts 2 to 7 bits of randomness per key press. When itthinks it has gathered at least 1024 bits of randomness, it&ldquo;stirs&rdquo; the pool of bits with a strong psuedo-randomizingfunction, and then takes 1024 bits and appends them in hexadecimal (base16) to the output window. </p><p>You can copy this text to the clipboard to use in MakeKeys orelsewhere.When MakeRand is run inside Mini vMac, you can gettext out of the emulated Macintosh using the &ldquo;Host Copy&rdquo;command in the Edit Menu. It is like the &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command,except that it uses the clipboard of the real computer insteadof the clipboard of the emulated computer. The keyboard shortcutis Command-Option-C. (The &ldquo;Host Copy&rdquo; command hassimilar effect to using the normal &ldquo;Copy&rdquo; command and then<a href="../clipout/index.html">ClipOut</a>.)</p><p>If you want more than 1024 bits, you can keep typing to generateanother block. If you want fewer bits, at any time you can click on thestatus bar (at the bottom of the window below the editing area)to save the bits collected so far. The status bar displays a count ofhow many bits have been collected.</p><p>MakeRand does use the text you type, so how random it is doesaffect how random the output is. Perfectly typing in a passagefrom a book adds very little true randomness. Making lots of typosadds more randomness. Typing in gibberish is better. Mashingkeys randomly might be better yet, except that people aren't verygood at truly being random. Also, if you try to press keys randomly,you might easily fall into a simple rhythm, which would reduce therandomness of the timing, which is more important than the keys pressed.</p><p>MakeRand is in part descended from MacPGP source code, which, as far asI can tell, allows derived works for noncommercial use.</p><p>MacPGP has various code to try to protect secrets from other softwarerunning on the computer. MakeRand does not. If you are using the randomdata for something sensitive, such as with MakeKeys, you should insteadtry to secure the entire virtual machine that it is run in. Such as byputting the Mini vMac disk image on an encrypted volume of the hostcomputer, for a start.</p><p>MacPGP uses the time manager to try to determine more precisely whenkeys are pressed. But in Mini vMac, the emulated keyboard can onlygenerate presses at each sixtieth of a second. So MakeRand onlyuses the &ldquo;ticks&rdquo; value for key presses (time in sixtiethsof a second), so it won&rsquo;t think it has more randomness thanit really has when run in Mini vMac. How much randomness MakeRandcounts for each keypress depends on how long it has been since thelast key press: 0 ticks = 2 bits, 1 tick = 3 bits, 2 - 3 ticks = 4 bits,4 - 7 ticks = 5 bits, 8 - 15 ticks = 6 bits, 16 or more ticks = 7 bits.</p><p>The Abort command in the File menu (shortcut: Command-Period)resets the count of randomness to zero, but it does not clearthe pool of random bits. So if you worry that MakeRand is too optimisticin its estimate of randomness, you can use the Abort commandto accumulate more, before the count reaches 1024 bits and outputproduced.</p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling MakeRand from the source code. </p><p> : </p><p> If you find MakeRand useful, please consider<a href="../../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../../index.html"><img src="../../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="../index.html">extras</a>/makerand- <a href="../../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
