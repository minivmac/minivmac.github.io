If they are installedin a Macintosh system, then Command-Shift-5will open the first Desk Accessory item from the Applemenu (not including the initial "About" item or otheritems provided by the application),Command-Shift-6 will open the second item,and so on up to Command-Shift-9 which opens thefifth item. (Command-Shift-1 through Command-Shift-4are already used by Apple.) </p><p> You can rename the Desk Accessoriesyou wish to use with DAFKEY, so that theystart with '5-', '6-', and so on. This puts themin order in front of all the Desk Accessories whosenames start with letters, and provides a reminderof how to open them with DAFKEY. </p><p> <a href="../clipout/index.html">ClipOut</a> and<a href="../clipin/index.html">ClipIn</a> are providedalready named this way, as '5-ClipOut'and '6-ClipIn'. I normally use Command-Shift-5 forClipOut, and Command-Shift-6 for ClipIn,and so have those as items one and two in theApple menu. </p><p> DAFKEY works in System 6 and earlier, and alsoworks fine in System 7, where it can be usedto open things in the "Apple Menu Items" folderbesides Desk Accessories. </p><p> DAFKEY may be installed using ResEdit(listed on my"<a href="../../../sw/progtool/index.html">Programming Tools</a>"page). Open the DAFKEY file with ResEdit, thenselect the FKEYs and choose "Copy".Next, while still in ResEdit, open the "System" file inthe "System Folder" of a bootable disk. Then choose"Paste".(If the "System" file is on the disk you are currentlybooted from, ResEdit will give a warning, but the abovestill seems to work.) </p><p> You don't need to install all five of theFKEYs, just install as many as you want to use. </p><p> You can also renumber them if you want. Forexample, if I want to use <a href="../daopener/index.html">DAOpener</a>,which launches the first item, and stillhave ClipOut and ClipIn available withthe usual keys, but as items two and three,then I could discard FKEY-5,renumber FKEY 6 to FKEY 5, and FKEY 7 to FKEY 6. </p><p> DAFKEY works by creating a private copy ofthe Apple menu with AddResMenu, then gettingthe name of the appropriate menu item, and usingthat to call OpenDeskAcc (which normally iscalled by the application in response to theuser choosing an item in the Apple menu). </p><p> Warning: DAFKEY is not compatible with allapplications. Some applications may get confusedwhen Desk Accessories open in this unexpectedfashion, and not properly copy their privateclipboard to or from the global clipboard,for example. </p><p> Warning: you should only invoke DAFKEY in situationswhere Desk Accessories can be chosen from the Apple menu,otherwise unpleasant things might happen. </p><p> <a name="alpha"> <b>Alpha version</b> in development </a> </p><p>The binary of the Alpha version is so far identical to the stableversion above, but the source code is different, being portedto <a href="../reasm/index.html">ReAsm</a>.</p><p> Download Alpha </p><blockquote><p> <a href="../../../../d/minivmac/extras/dafkey/dafkey-191201.zip">dafkey-191201.zip</a>(<a href="../../../../d/minivmac/extras/dafkey/dafkey-191201.inf.txt">info</a>)a zipped hfs disk image and checksum file.The disk image can be mounted with Mini vMac.Includes source code. </p></blockquote><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the Alpha download, signed with<a href="../../../keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------49a0ba9e3048d20e2652b97c4a9b43a1 dafkey-191201.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/MZPM3u/F1kgVYy3qI6rMzDAbDV9hUNjgwPFeCbZFx6nmKTVZzQiXyIXdmBkHbudLYEx8UaVkkiPvgdqgPXkHoVi9BxpwuihIcCPDuuzI5q+lPSPANf1RSxxHIGryYGJypCqgw6TiJ8JV5qNh5ydyrdKQDJtZC5dLgDmklGiuEO5kz0j-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> You can redistribute DAFKEY and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
