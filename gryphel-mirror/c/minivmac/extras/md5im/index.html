(It combines the functionality of the<a href="../md5fl/index.html">Md5Fl</a>and <a href="../importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>applications.) </p><p> Note that there are numerous programs for various operating systemsthat will compute an md5 checksum, way faster thanMd5Im can run in emulation. However, because there are so many,I'm not going to support any of them. (That is, I won't document using them,or answer questions about using them.) Md5Im will workidentically on all computers that can run Mini vMac. </p><p> When Md5Im is the active application running in the emulated computer,then any of the methods normally used to mount a disk image willinstead checksum a file. For example, dragging the icon of the file tobe checksummed into the Mini vMac window. </p><p> <b>warning:</b> When attempting to use Md5Im, if you see adialog asking if you want to initialize the disk, choose&ldquo;Eject&rdquo;, not &ldquo;Initialize&rdquo;!This will happen if Md5Im is notactually the active application, in which case the fileyou are attempting to checksum is treated as a disk image.Choosing &ldquo;Initialize&rdquo; will turn it into a valid disk image,destroying parts of the previous content. </p><p> The calculated md5 checksum will be displayed in Md5Im'swindow. The checksum will also be placed on the clipboard of thereal computer (not the clipboard of the emulated computer).Before replacing the contents of the clipboard it willexamine the old contents and see if matches the new value. Ifit matches, an "equals" sign is displayed on the right side of Md5Im'swindow. If it doesn't match, but the old content looks like an md5 checksum,then a "not equals" sign is displayed. Otherwise, if the old contentdoesn't look like an md5 checksum, no extra symbol is displayed. </p><p> For example, to verify the Md5Im zip archive, copy"4346163700a994edca6ac1588ed6d2e8" (not including the quotes)onto the clipboard ofyour real computer, run the Md5Im application in Mini vMac,and then drag the icon of the file "md5im-1.2.0.zip" ontothe Mini vMac window. The Md5Im window should display"4346163700a994edca6ac1588ed6d2e8" followed by an"equals" sign. </p><p> Md5Im was created using md5 code from glibc-2.3.4, copyrightthe Free Software Foundation, and written by Ulrich Drepper. </p><p> The name "Md5Im" stands for "MD5 of IMported file". </p><p> See the <a href="../../appc/index.html">Compiling</a>page for instructions on compiling Md5Im from the source code. </p><p> You can redistribute Md5Im and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
