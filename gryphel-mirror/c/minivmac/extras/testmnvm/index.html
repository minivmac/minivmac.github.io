I'm making itpublic since even what there is of it so far can be usefulto give some assurance when you have compiled your own copyof Mini vMac that it has compiled correctly. </p><p> TestMnvM is simply an application that when run inside Mini vMacputs up an alert saying either "Seems Ok", or else a briefdescription of where it found a problem. </p><p> TestMnvM is not useful if the emulation is too broken, sothat it can't boot at all. (Gwenole Beauchesne's <a href="http://gwenole.beauchesne.info/en/blog/2007/07/08/m68k_emulator_testsuite">M68K Emulator Testsuite</a>looks better for that. Sometime I will have to try to getit to work with Mini vMac code.)It is more useful for giving somereassurance that a program that seems to work doesn'thave obscure bugs. </p><p> Currently TestMnvM is mostly focused on testing the resultsof a few 68000 instructions on selected example parameters,with special attention to making sure the condition codesare set correctly. (If condition codes aren't handledcorrectly, the emulator may seem to mostly work, exceptfor occasional odd behavior, which is worse than notworking at all.) This checks out the part of the emulationthat does the computations, but since it uses only oneform of each instruction, rather than all the possibleaddressing modes, it is not testing the decodingof instructions. </p><p> You can redistribute TestMnvM and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
