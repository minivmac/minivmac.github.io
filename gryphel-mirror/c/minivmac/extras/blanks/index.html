For example, unzip &ldquo;800K.zip&rdquo;to get &ldquo;800K.dsk&rdquo;, an 800K blank disk image, the size ofa floppy disk normally used by a real Macintosh Plus.</p><p> For information about using disk images in Mini vMac,see the '<a href="../../hardware.html#floppy_drives">Floppy Drive</a>'section of the Hardware Reference.To transfer files from your realcomputer into and out of disk image files, see the utilities<a href="../importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a> and<a href="../exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>.</p><p> The top level of the blanks folder contains 2 other disk imagesin the sizes of standard Macintosh floppy disks: 400K and1440K. A real Macintosh Plus floppy drive could use 400K disks,but not 1440K, which came later. But Mini vMac doesn'temulate the real floppy drive, replacing the disk driverin ROM, and so can use any size disk image, not just 400K and 800K. </p><p> The &ldquo;K&rdquo; folder contains disk images smaller than 1 megabyte,in powers of 2 starting at 128K (the smallest that works),and also multiples 1.25, 1.50, and 1.75 of those powers. </p><p> The &ldquo;M&rdquo; folder contains disk images larger or equal to1 megabyte, up to 224M. In general, it may not a good idea touse the largest sizes, for reasons described below. </p><p>The &ldquo;mfs&rdquo; folder contains disk images in theMFS format (Macintosh File System).All the other disk images in Blanks are in &ldquo;HFS&rdquo; format (Hierarchical File System), the standard for a Macintosh Plus.MFS preceded HFS. The original Macintosh 128K and 512K can only use MFSand not HFS. A Macintosh Plus can use either.</p><p> The &ldquo;dc42&rdquo; folder contains disk images withthe Disk Copy 4.2 header, and having filetags and checksums. (All the other disk images in Blanks are&ldquo;raw&rdquo;, containing just image data with no headeror trailer.)Mini vMac can supportfile tags with the build system option &ldquo;<a href="../../options.html#option_sony_tag">-sony-tag 1</a>&rdquo;,and can support checksums with the build system option&ldquo;<a href="../../options.html#option_sony_sum">-sony-sum 1</a>&rdquo;. </p><p> If you're thinking of using large disk images, keep in mindthat it is not a good idea to create one giant disk image forall your work. One reason is that the HFS file system is limited to a maximumof 65535 allocation blocks. So the minimum block size increases forlarger disks, meaning more wasted space. (HFS Plus fixed thisproblem, but isn't supported on a Macintosh Plus.) Another reasonit is a bad idea is that a Macintosh Plus doesn't have the memoryprotection of modern computers, so that a bug in any programcan potentially corrupt mounted disks. It is safer to have separatedisk images for separate purposes. This way Mini vMac givesthe same benefits of memory protection, and more. No matter what programyou run in the emulated machine, nothing can be harmed exceptthe disk images that are mounted at the time. (Unless therewas a major bug in Mini vMac, of course.) </p><p> If you're using Mini vMac on a Macintosh, you mightwant to set the file type and creator of yournew disk image file, using&ldquo;<a href="../setftype/index.html">SetFType</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> It is a good idea to rename the disksinside the emulated machine, instead of leavingthe default name &ldquo;untitled&rdquo;. Because if twodifferent mounted disks have the same name,some programs can become confused. (The name ofthe disk which you see in the emulated machineis completely separate from the name of thedisk image file). </p><p> Another issue is that when youmake multiple copies of these blank disk images,they will have the same creation date. This canmake a difference if you use &ldquo;Aliases&rdquo; in System 7.The Macintosh system software can mistakenly decidethat an already mounted disk is the disk it is looking for,particularly if it has the same creation date as the correct disk.If you might encounter this problem, before using one of the blank disk imagesyou can erase it(with the &ldquo;Erase Disk...&rdquo; command in the Special menu of the Finder)to make sure it has a unique creation date. </p><p> You can also create your own blank disk images of anysize. If you try to mount a file in Mini vMacwhich isn't a disk image (preferably allzeroes) the operating system of the emulatedmachine will ask if you want to initializeit. Choosing 'Initialize' will makea perfectly good disk image. You can createzeroed files in the terminal of Mac OS X,or Linux, with commands such as: </p><pre>dd if=/dev/zero of=my_image.dsk count=14336</pre><p> This creates a 7 Megabyte file, named 'my_image.dsk',in the current directory. 'count'is the number of 512 byte blocks. </p><p> For Microsoft Windows, it is<a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1901083&amp;forum_id=68723">reported</a>that the command line utility<a href="http://www.emulators.com/download.htm#UTILITIES">MAKEDSK</a>will make zero-filled files. The same archive also containsMAKEIMG which generates formatted disk images. However, accordingto Disk First Aid and Norton Utilities, the disk images it generatesare not quite in standard HFS format, so it may be safer just touse MAKEDSK, and let Mac OS in the emulated computer do the formatting. </p><p> If you create a zeroed disk image file on a Macintosh,and wish to set the file type and creator with<a href="../setftype/index.html">SetFType</a>, you shouldfirst mount the zeroed file in Mini vMac to initializeit, unmount it, and then use SetFType. If you useSetFType before initializing the file, it won'tknow that the file is supposed to be a disk image. </p><p> News: </p><p><b> August 13, 2020 </b>version 1.1 adds a 720K HFS image, by<a href="../../../mail/v11.html#m259">request</a>.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Blanks useful, please consider<a href="../../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../../index.html"><img src="../../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="../index.html">extras</a>/blanks- <a href="../../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
