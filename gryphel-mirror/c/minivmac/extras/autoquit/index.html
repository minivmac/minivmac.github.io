For applicationsthat require System 7, you can use<a href="../autquit7/index.html">AutQuit7</a>. </p><p> <b>Discussion and Example</b> </p><p> The basic way to use Mini vMac is to open a boot disk image,which brings up the Finder. From there you can launch anapplication, such as the game 'Continuum'. When you're done,you quit from 'Continuum'. This brings you back to the Finder,where you can choose the 'Shut Down' command, and then youcan safely quit Mini vMac.  </p><p> You can save one step if you prepare a boot disk image thatcontains 'Continuum', and set the 'Start Up' application tothe game. Now booting from this disk image will launchthe program 'Continuum' directly, skipping the Finder. </p><p> But when you quit from 'Continuum', you still end up back inthe Finder, where you have to 'Shut Down' and quit Mini vMac. </p><p> You can save these extra steps by replacing the Finder on theboot disk image with the file 'AutoQuit'.Now quitting from 'Continuum' will automatically 'Shut Down'and quit Mini vMac. </p><p> AutoQuit is just a simple program that immediately shuts downa Macintosh, and, when running inside Mini vMac,tells Mini vMac to quit. You use it by settingan application to be the Start Up application of abootable disk, and then replacing the Finder withAutoQuit, so that AutoQuit is run when the applicationquits. In more detail: </p><p> <b>Instructions</b> </p><p> * Download and unzip AutoQuit, to get the AutoQuit diskimage. </p><p> * Create a bootable system disk image containing System 6.0.8or earlier. </p><p> * Install an application on this disk image, and verify thatit works properly. </p><p> * In the Finder, select the icon of the application,and choose the "Set Startup..." command from the Special menu. </p><p> * Boot from a different disk image. </p><p> * Mount the original disk image with the application, and open the System Folderon it. </p><p> * Drag the file 'Finder' into the Trash. </p><p> * Choose 'Empty Trash' from the Special menu. </p><p> * Mount the AutoQuit disk image, and copy the file 'AutoQuit'into the System Folder. </p><p> * Rename the copy of 'AutoQuit' to 'Finder'. </p><p> * Close the System Folder. </p><p> * Choose 'Shut Down' from the Special menu. </p><p> <b>More details</b> </p><p> If the shift key is held down, AutoQuit will shut downthe emulated machine, but won't quit from Mini vMac.This makes it a bit easier to immediately use anotherdisk image. </p><p> AutoQuit will check to make sure that it is runninginside of Mini vMac before trying to make Mini vMacquit. This means it is safe to use in other emulators.So you can prepare a disk image with a wrappedapplication for Mini vMac, and still use it withanother emulator. </p><p> It is also safe to use it on a real machine. Thisis useful with"<a href="../copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>".You canset the CopyRoms program as the Start Up applicationon a floppy disk, and replace the Finder withAutoQuit. You can then use this floppy to acquirethe ROM image from a Macintosh, even if thekeyboard, mouse, and/or screen don't work. </p><p> Some programs will not work as the Start Upapplication. <a href="../dolaunch/index.html">DoLaunch</a>provides a fix for this. </p><p> You can redistribute AutoQuit and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.
