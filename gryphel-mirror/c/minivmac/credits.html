(Please alsosee the list of<a href="../wishlist/granted.html">Sponsors of the Gryphel Project.</a>)</p><!--<p> <b> * * * to be updated * * * </b> </p>--><p>Mini vMac is based upon Richard F. Bannister&rsquo;s Macintosh port ofvMac. See:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.bannister.org/software/">http://www.bannister.org/software/</a>	</p>		<p>	(vMac for Macintosh no longer seems to	be available here.)	</p></blockquote><p>vMac was written by Philip Cummins and others.Please see this credits page:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.vmac.org/credits.html">http://www.vmac.org/credits.html</a>	</p></blockquote><p>The vMac home page is:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.vmac.org">http://www.vmac.org</a>	</p></blockquote><p>If that page looks blank with your browser, try</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.vmac.org/main.html">http://www.vmac.org/main.html</a>	</p></blockquote><p>The downloads area for vMac currently seems to be broken.</p><p>The port to Microsoft Windows used as a startingpoint the Windows port of vMac, by Weston Pawlowski,Bill Miller, Ryan Hill, and Mike Voellinger.Additional contributors to the Windows portof vMac include Andre Masella, Lauri Pesonen,Hoshi Takanori, Jose Urena and Darek Michocka.vMac for Windows can be found atthe vMac home page.</p><p>The port to PocketPC is by Fabio Concas. See:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://jpdefault.altervista.org/?p=software&amp;id=minivmac">http://jpdefault.altervista.org/?p=software&amp;id=minivmac</a>	</p></blockquote><p>The port to the X Window System used as a startingpoint the X port of vMac, by Michael Hanni.Additional contributors to the X port ofvMac include Ian Stephenson, Matt, Frederic Roussel,and Sam Strohl.vMac for X can be found at the vMac home page.</p><p>Initial sound support in the Linux version using ALSA is by StephanKochen. The technique to dynamically load the ALSA library, so thatMini vMac can still run if it is not present, was seen in<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>source code.</p><p>The port to the<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>2.0 API is based upon a<a href="https://github.com/vanfanel/minivmac_sdl2">port by Manuel Alfayate</a>(based on the existing port to SDL 1.2).</p><p><a href="http://www.ripserve.com/perkins/">John Perkins</a>made sure Mini vMac can be compiled for IRIX.</p><p>The French translation of the program strings is by Pierre Lemieux,with some proofreading assistance by Ga&euml;l Coup&eacute;.Pierre Lemieux also made many suggestions for the English strings.<!-- , and alsohas translated much of the Mini vMac documentation to French, on hiswebsite at: --></p><!--<blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://pages.videotron.com/plemieux/minivmac/">http://pages.videotron.com/plemieux/minivmac/</a>.	</p></blockquote>--><p>The Italian translation of the program strings was originally by<a href="http://jpdefault.altervista.org/">Fabio Concas</a>,with later updates by Gianluca Abbiati.</p><p>The German translation of the program strings is by<a href="http://www.classics-for-x.info/">Detlef Kahner</a>.</p><p>The Dutch translation of the program strings is by<a href="http://luc.xalasys.com/">Luc Pauwels</a>.</p><p>The Spanish translation of the program strings is by<!-- <a href="http://www.geocities.com/chir_geo/"></a> --> Chir.</p><p>The Polish translation of the program strings is byPrzemys&#322;aw Buczkowski.</p><p>The Brazilian Portuguese translation of the program strings is by<a href="http://www.mteam7.com/en/">Mauricio</a>.</p><p>The Catalan translation of the program strings is byArduinoXino.</p><p>The Czech translation of the program strings is byAnonymous.</p><p>The Serbian translation of the program strings is bySerbXenomorph.</p><p>Since I have never done any X programming before,I learned more by looking at other programs, such as<a href="http://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a>,the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_(emulator)">UAE Amiga Emulator</a>,<a href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/">Bochs</a>,<a href="http://www.quakeforge.net/">QuakeForge</a>,<a href="http://doomlegacy.sourceforge.net">DooM Legacy</a>, and the<a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>.A few snippets from them are used in Mini vMac.</p><p>The core cpu emulation code of vMac was adapted from the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE_(emulator)">UAE Amiga Emulator</a>by Bernd Schmidt.</p><p>The FPU (Floating Point Unit) emulation was originallywritten for Mini vMac by Ross Martin. This code was modifiedto use SoftFloat, by John Hauser (as found in the Bochs emulator),plus some extensions to SoftFloat by Stanislav Shwartsman(also found in Bochs).Though using SoftFloat is slower than using native floating point,it ensures consistent results on different computers,and makes it easier to compile with different development environments.</p><p><a href="http://basilisk.cebix.net/">Basilisk II</a> source codewas a useful reference when implementing video card emulation(used for Macintosh II emulation).</p><p><a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a> source code(now merged into<a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a>), had usefulhints for emulating the Apple Sound Chip (forMacintosh II emulation).</p><p>Improvements to the support of Disk Copy 4.2 format diskimages are from Jes&uacute;s A. &Aacute;lvarez's ("zydeco")<a href="http://namedfork.net/minivmac/">iPhone/iPod Touch port</a>,using information found in the<a href="http://lisa.sunder.net/">Lisa Emulator Project</a>by Ray A. Arachelian.</p><p>LocalTalk emulation was written for Mini vMac by<a href="http://mfort.net/Mini_vMac_LT/Mini_vMac_LT.html">Mike Fort</a>.</p><p>LocalTalk over UDP was written by Rob Mitchelmore.</p><p>Support for emulation of the &ldquo;Twiggy&rdquo; Macintoshprototype is by Mat&#283;j Hybler.</p><p>The alternate &ldquo;Happy Mac&rdquo; icons are by<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/">Steve Chamberlin</a>.</p><p>The code for moving the mouse in Mac OS 9 and earlieris adapted from MoveMouse.c by Dan Sears, which says thatit is &ldquo;Based on code from Jon Wtte, Denis Pelli,Apple, and a timely suggestion from Bo Lindbergh.&rdquo;It also says that &lsquo;For documentation of the CDM, see AppleTech Note &ldquo;HW 01 - ADB (The Untold Story: Space Aliensate my mouse)&rdquo;&rsquo;.</p><p>The trick to moving the mouse in Mac OS X withoutthe mouse freezing for a moment was found in&ldquo;SDL_QuartzWM.m&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Simple DirectMedia Layer&rdquo;,Copyright (C) 1997-2003 Sam Lantinga. See:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.libsdl.org/index.php">http://www.libsdl.org/index.php</a>	</p></blockquote> <p>Advice from Toni Willen (of WinUAE), obtained by"easymode", was a helpful starting point in figuring outhow to not monopolize the processor in the Windows version.</p> <p>Drag and Drop support in the X version isbased on the specification&ldquo;XDND: Drag-and-Drop Protocol for the X Window System&rdquo;developed by John Lindal at New Planet Software, andthe included examples, one by Paul Sheer. See:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDND/">https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/XDND/</a>	</p></blockquote><p>Code for hiding the cursor in the X version is adaptedfrom X11_CreateNullCursor in context.x11.c inquakeforge 0.5.5, copyright Id Software, Inc.Zephaniah E. Hull, and Jeff Teunissen. See:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="http://www.quakeforge.net/">http://www.quakeforge.net</a>	</p></blockquote><p>The jdate function used in the Windows and X version ofMini vMac is from &ldquo;Webalizer - a web server log analysisprogram&rdquo; by Bradford L.
