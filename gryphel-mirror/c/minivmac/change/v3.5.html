If using it as you would previouslywould behave differently, that is "changed behavior". --><!----><p> * None Yet. </p><p> <a name="modified"> <b> Changed behavior in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *Mini vMac should be faster on machines that aren&rsquo;t PowerPC orx86-32. (And also Macintosh II emulation should be faster.)The C version of the 680x0 CPU emulation was optimized tobe about as fast as the previous assembly code (that was onlyimplemented for 68000 emulation on PowerPC and x86-32), and thenthe assembly code was removed. So Mini vMac should be muchfaster for variations where the old assembly code could not be used.Also, the x86-64 version is now faster than the old x86-32 assembly,and so is now preferred on machines that can run both x86-64 and x86-32.(On OS X, various bug fixes should make the Cocoa port now work aswell as Carbon port, which wasn&rsquo;t available on x86-64.)The C code is tweaked for a specific version of the GCC compiler.While other compilers are still supported, they can result insignificantly slower emulation.</p><p> *If Mini vMac reports an &ldquo;Abnormal Situation&rdquo;, it nowalso displays a 4 digit hexadecimal number. The original idea wasthat if something unexpected happens, you should first figure out howto reproduce the problem. Then the same thing can be done on a copyof Mini vMac with debugging stuff enabled. But this ideadoesn&rsquo;t work out so well if the problem can&rsquo;t bereproduced, and seems to happen randomly and rarely. So now thenon debug version of Mini vMac will display a number, whichdoesn&rsquo;t take much code, so at least something can be learned.</p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *A badly behaved program could cause Mini vMac to crash, attempting tofetch an emulated instruction from random memory, which memoryprotection on a modern computer prevents. Since this is only a bad read,I don&rsquo;t think any further harm was possible besides crashing Mini vMac.Most kinds of memory access emulated by Mini vMac have for a quite whilebeen designed to always be accurate and safe. But for speed,fetching the next instruction would simply increment a pointer to wherethe instruction is in real memory, and relative branches would justoffset this pointer. Only for certain long branches would Mini vMac workout from scratch where the instruction is in real memory. This is goodenough for all known correctly working software. But it is in theorypossible to write code so that the pointer to the next instruction getsset to arbitrary memory that the operating system may not allow MinivMac to access, resulting in a crash. And not just in theory, I haveseen this happen in programs running in Mini vMac that weremalfunctioning.  This bug is fixed by keeping low and high limits forthe instruction pointer, and checking against them as the pointer ischanged.</p><p> *There is now some testing code that scrambles the mapping betweenemulated memory (for RAM and ROM) and real memory, splittingit into two sets of interleaved blocks (in effect togglingone bit of the address). Which exercises all the newboundary checking code. With a number of bug fixes it all worked.</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, entering Full Screen should now work inrecent versions of OS X, instead of immediately exiting. Forsafety Mini vMac automatically leaves full screen mode if it noticesthe screen size has changed, implemented in the Cocoa port bylooking for the notification applicationDidChangeScreenParameters.But recent OS X gives this notification on entering Full Screenmode, when it didn&rsquo;t used to. So the Cocoa now records the mainscreent Rect, and only exits full screen mode if it has changed.This problem was<a href="../../mail/v3.html#m61">reported by Tim</a>.</p><p> *The Cocoa port would draw incorrectly in full screen mode ifthe emulated screen is larger than real screen.</p><p> *There is a fix for drag and drop in the Cocoa port.When Mini vMac becomes the active application, all emulated key areusually considered to be up, even if the actual keys are still beingheld down. But there is an exception for modifier keys held down on dragand drop (after which Mini vMac makes itself the active application), sothat holding down command and option can be used to rebuild the desktopfiles of emulated disks. This exception worked in Carbon, but notpreviously in Cocoa. I&rsquo;ve now figured out how to get the modifier keys,by using [NSEvent modifierFlags]. This only work in OS X 10.6 and later,so Mini vMac checks that this method is available before using it.</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, when Mini vMacis launched by dragging a disk onto the application icon, but thereis also a disk1.dsk image, it now matches the behavior of otherports in mounting the dragged image after disk1.dsk instead ofbefore.</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, when importing and exporting the text clipboard,Mini vMac was not translating the end of line format.</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, when importing the text clipboard, if there wereany characters that could not be translated (because they are not inMacRoman), nothing would be translated. Now, such characters willtranslate to &ldquo;?&rdquo;.</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, when dragging the Mini vMac windowaround by its title bar, the emulated cursor position wasincorrect. (The emulation continues running during thedrag in this port.)</p><p> *In the Cocoa port, if the mouse is moved over the dock, thecursor is made visible by the operating system, but if themouse was then moved directly back into the Mini vMac window(and there was nothing in between), the system cursor was not madeinvisible again, so the system cursor and the cursor of theemulated Macintosh were drawn on top of each other.</p><p> *In the Windows version of Mini vMac 3.4, the Mini vMac windowis resizable. This happened when fixing a call to CreateWindowExto stop using an invalid window style. The fix is now fixedby not including WS_THICKFRAME in the style.</p><p> *There have been reports of graphics problems in the Linux version,which is suspected to result from drawingimages with one bit per pixel to the screen not beingproperly implemented in at least some versions of Linux,with at least some hardware. So Mini vMac will now always pass 32bit per pixel images to the operating system (for Linux andother X versions), even forblack and white images. This could potentially be much lessefficient, so there is a new compile time option to behaveas before,&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_ci">-ci 0</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> *A C compiler is allowed to assumethat two pointers of different types don&rsquo;t point to the samememory location. But this assumption could break Mini vMac.So now for GCC 4.7.4 the option "-fno-strict-aliasing" isused to prevent this assumption, which appears to make nosignificant difference in speed. But for other compilers,Mini vMac will now try to work correctly even with thisassumption (basically by taking out optimizations forbig/little endian), which will slow it down a bit.</p><p> *The emulation of the CMPI instruction was considering pc relativeaddressing to be illegal, when it is actually fine (though odd). As<a href="../../mail/v5.html#m5">reported by Adam</a>, thisbroke Dynamix adventure games. This was in Macintosh II emulation,but the bug was also present in the default Macintosh Plus emulation.</p><p> *The emulation of the Move to SR instruction now checks forPrivilege Violation.</p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lang">-lang ptb</a>&rdquo;selects a Brazilian Portuguese translation of the user interface by<a href="http://www.mteam7.com/en/">Mauricio</a>.</p><p> *Normally, when in Full Screen Mode, Mini vMacwill try to &ldquo;grab&rdquo; the keyboard, preventing the operatingsystem from intercepting keys. So in the Windows version,the &lsquo;windows&rsquo; key can be used as an &lsquo;option&rsquo; key, insteadof popping up the &ldquo;Start&rdquo; menu. And in theOS X version, Command-Tab won&rsquo;t switch away from Mini vMac.This is also implemented in the X version. There is a new build option,<a href="../options.html#option_gkf">-gkf 0</a>&rdquo;, thatdisables grabbing the keyboard, allowingthe operating system to intercept keys when Mini vMac isin Full Screen Mode. This was<a href="../../mail/v3.html#m70">requested</a>by a maintainer for &ldquo;Rocket Launcher&rdquo;.</p><p> *Can now use a &ldquo;Twiggy&rdquo; Macintosh prototype ROM,after merging in work by Mat&#283;j Hybler.(There are two known disk images that will work with it.)The build option is<a href="../develop.html#option_m">-m Twiggy</a>&rdquo;.(This is not an officially supported option, advanced userscan compile this version if they want to try it.)</p><p> *Can now also use an even earlier &ldquo;Twiggy&rdquo; Macintoshprototype ROM, merging in further work by Mat&#283;j Hybler.(The same two disk images will work with it.)The build option is<a href="../develop.html#option_m">-m Twig43</a>&rdquo;.(This is not an officially supported option, advanced userscan compile this version if they want to try it.)</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_ahm">-ahm</a>&rdquo;patches the ROM to replace the &ldquo;Happy Mac&rdquo; icon displayedon boot when a disk is inserted, with one of the images designedby Steve Chamberlin for his<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator/">Mac ROM-inator</a>(used with permission).</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_rsz">-rsz</a>&rdquo;allows you to set the size that Mini vMac expects the ROM image to be.The build system will normally select the correct ROM Sizefor the Macintosh model you have chosen to emulate. Butyou can now override this, such as to use a ROM image forSteve Chamberlin&rsquo;s<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator/">Mac ROM-inator</a>.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_chr">-chr 0</a>&rdquo;prevents Mini vMac from checking the ROM checksum.The first 4 bytes of a Macintosh ROM contain a checksum ofthe remaining bytes, and there is code in the ROM to checkthe checksum on boot. Mini vMac patches the ROM image, soit disables this checking code. Mini vMac does the checkitself before patching the ROM. It also checks that the4 byte checksum matches one of the known ROM imagesfor the  model you have chosen to emulate.This option disables these checks, which is usefulif you want to use Mini vMac with a modified ROM image, suchas for Steve Chamberlin&rsquo;s<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator/">Mac ROM-inator</a>.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_drc">-drc 0</a>&rdquo;prevents Mini vMac from disabling code in ROM that checksthe ROM checksum on boot.Since Mini vMac patches the ROM, it also patchesout this check. If you are using a ROM image with Mini vMac thatis already patched (such as for Steve Chamberlin&rsquo;s<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/mac-rom-inator/">Mac ROM-inator</a>), this check may already be patched out. In that case Mini vMacdoesn&rsquo;t need to, and probably shouldn&rsquo;t, to avoid interferencein case a different method of patching out is used.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_drt">-drt 0</a>&rdquo;prevents Mini vMac from disabling code in ROM that testsproper operation of RAM at boot. Mini vMac normally patches the ROMto disable this test, to speed up booting. For greater realism, youcan leave this test in.</p><p> *The port to SDL 2 now supports importing and exporting the hostclipboard (like most other ports). It also supports the same&ldquo;-d&rdquo; and &ldquo;-r&rdquo; command line options asthe X ports. And it now uses the function SDL_GetBasePath forthe directory to look for the ROM image and the disk1.dsk, disk2.dsk,etc. images (and also the debug log file, when enabled).In the OS X version, in the "Info.plist" file it uses the key"SDL_FILESYSTEM_BASE_DIR_TYPE" with value "parent", so thatMini vMac will looking for these images inthe folder containing Mini vMac, like in most other ports.It also now ignores command line arguments startingwith &ldquo;-psn&rdquo;, which on OS X allows it to be launchedby double clicking without getting an error message. (Previouslyit had to be launched with the command line.) Like otherports, there are now separate magnify states for when infull screen mode and when not. And when first entering full screenmode, the magnify state is set automatically depending on thescreen size. A new feature only in the SDL port so faris that using the scroll wheel of the mouse acts as ifarrow keys are pressed, giving roughly the expected behaviorof a scroll wheel.</p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * In the Macintosh II emulation, when compiled with 256colors or 16 colors or 4 colors, the initial valuein the Parameter RAM is now set to boot in color.So the initial picture is in color. (Soon after,the color mode is changed to the value saved ondisk.) This didn&rsquo;t use to work, which is why itwas previously set to boot in black and white.It seems to work now, for reasons not investigatedyet (probably one of various fixes to video emulation).It still doesn&rsquo;t work for thousands or millionsof colors.</p><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *The video driver in the Macintosh II emulation now implementsindexed SetEntries. This is used by the game Crystal Quest(which by the way requires color depth to be 16 colors).Also for non-indexed SetEntries, the driver now returnsthe no error code. (Apparently this error code isnot usually paid attention to.)</p><p> *Tara Keeling reported a bug in the Macintosh II emulation,where if the emulation was running slow enough (such as 1x speed),and there is a &ldquo;disk1.disk&rdquo; and&ldquo;disk2.disk&rdquo;, then the second disk image won&rsquo;tget mounted. There is code to delay mounting the second diskone second after the first disk, which is good enough forMacintosh Plus emulation, but apparently not for the Macintosh II.So the delay has been increased to four seconds, but also now whena kDriveStatus call is made to the replacement disk driver, thedelay is reduced (to about a fifteenth second). The emulatedcomputer appears to be ready for a new disk after this call. (Notreducing the delay to zero is just being conservative.) So evenfor the default Macintosh Plus emulation, when insertingmultiple disks there is now usually much less delay.</p><p> *In the built in disassembler ("-dis"option), the shift instructions L and R were reversed(such as for ASR and ASL).</p><p> *A problem may be fixed in the Macintosh II emulation,<a href="../../mail/v4.html#m8">reported by Stephen Barbieri</a>,caused by the FPU emulation not coping with invalid inputs.</p><p> *In the Macintosh II emulation, an &ldquo;Abnormal Situation&rdquo;report seen when using the Restart command of the Finder has beenremoved, since this actually seems to work fine now.</p><p> *The emulation of the Move from SR instruction now checks forPrivilege Violation on 68020 (it is not a Privilege Violation on 68000).</p><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p> <!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *The build system has a new Development Environment option, MinivMac C (&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_e">-e mvc</a>&rdquo;),which is really just a particular versionof GCC and supporting projects, compiled into a set of crosscompilers, that is used for officialbinaries. The advantage of using a single compiler versionis in getting consistent performance across differentoperating systems. Also it easier to tweak C code to getgood performance for a single compiler, than to try to makecode that is optimum for all C compilers.</p><p> *The build system normally selects the source files needed tocompile the requested variation. There is now an optionto include all source files:<a href="../develop.html#option_all_src">-all-src 1</a>&rdquo;.To make this work, all source files now have unique names,rather than have multiple files with the same name indifferent folders in the source archive, for choices ofAPI, sound API, language, icons.</p><p> *Support for assembly language is removed, includingthe option &ldquo;-no-asm&rdquo;.</p><p> *There is now an option to put generated configuration filesinto a separate directory from the source files:&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_all_src">-cfg 1</a>&rdquo;.This is only supported for&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_e">-e mvc</a>&rdquo;.</p><p> *The Export command would not overwrite an existing file(after the Standard Put File dialog asks if you want to replace it).</p><p> * The build system now supports Xcode 7.3.1(with &ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_ev">-ev 7310</a>&rdquo;),and also 8.2.1 (&ldquo;-ev 8210&rdquo;).Though not tested,other versions of Xcode in between should also work, by constructingthe &ldquo;-ev&rdquo; option in the same way.</p><p> * The build system now supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2017(with &ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_ev">-ev 15000</a>&rdquo;).</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../index.html"><img src="../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v3.5- <a href="../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2017 Paul C.
