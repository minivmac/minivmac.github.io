Instead of the platform dependent code callinga routine to emulate one tick (sixtieth of a second) wheneverappropriate, the main loop of the program is now in platformindependent code, which periodically calls platform dependentcode to check for events. A visible consequence of this is thatthe emulation will now stop running in certain circumstanceswhen it used to continue running, such as during the open diskimage dialog. The exact situations this happens varies foreach platform.</p><p> * To minimize glitches in sound output when emulation starts,stops, or just isn't running fast enough, the sound call backfunctions in the various Macintosh versions and the SDL version willnow try to play an appropriate transition in each of thesecircumstances.</p><p> * In the Cocoa port, when the platform dependent code checks forevents, rather than using a time out value, it turns out thereis a bit less overhead to check for events, sleep, and thencheck for events again. This allows matching the performanceof the Carbon version, making the Cocoa version more readyfor prime time. (Apple has declared Carbon very, verydeprecated.)</p><p>The same fix actually also applies to Carbon. Mini vMacused to use a standard Carbon event loop with a complicatedsystem of timer events only because a manual event loopdidn't get quite as good performance. With this change, allports can use the same platform independent event loop,as described above.</p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The Virtual-Key Codes of Microsoft Windows, that are independentof differences in keyboard hardware, turn out not to be independentof the choice of Keyboard Layout. Changing the Keyboard Layoutto something other than "US" may scramble the Virtual-Key Codes,strangely enough. Mini vMac will now check the current KeyboardLayout, and attempt to unscramble the codes, so that the KeyboardLayout chosen in Macintosh operating system running within Mini vMacwill work properly. There is a new build option to disable thisfix, <a href="../options.html#option_ikb">-ikb 0</a>&rdquo;, becausethis is fairly large amount of code and US only users don't need it.But also because I'm not sure I really understand this. Why hasno one complained about this issue in the last decade?</p><p> * Mini vMac on Microsoft Windows will now recognize theVirtual-Key code of VK_OEM_102, and translate it to the Macintoshkey code of 0x0A. This key is used for angle brackets in theGerman keyboard layout, for example.</p><p> * Mini vMac on Microsoft Windows passed an invalid Window Styleto CreateWindowEx (when not in full screen mode). When compiledwith certain development tools this could result in the windowbeing the wrong size, and other odd behavior. Before findingand fixing this, I also made Mini vMac more robust in adjustingfor window border sizes by using AdjustWindowRectEx and MapWindowPoints,rather than various results from GetSystemMetrics. (Thanks tothe anonymous user who<a href="../../mail/v3.html#m27">reported this issue</a>.)</p><p> * The OS X version of Mini vMacwas using the wrong syntax for the value of the LSRequiresCarbonkey in the Info.plist file in the application bundle, as<a href="../../mail/v2.html#m43">reported by Ryan Schmidt</a>.</p><p> * The Linux, and other X, versions of Mini vMac would crashwhen exporting a file, if the &ldquo;out&rdquo; folder in theapplication directory didn't exist, and Mini vMac lackedpermission to create it, due to not properly handling errors in theroutine &ldquo;FindOrMakeChild&rdquo; in the source file&ldquo;MYOSGLUE.c&rdquo;, as<a href="../../mail/v2.html#m42">reported by &Eacute;ric of Montr&eacute;al</a>.</p><p> * The Linux, and other X, versions of Mini vMac can crashif the HOME environment variable is not set, due to missingerror checking (which in turn was due to incorrectly disabling analternate implementation), as<a href="../../mail/v2.html#m44">reported by fzn</a>.</p><p> * The Linux, and other X, versions of Mini vMac will nowlook for the ROM image in the application directory before lookingin the &ldquo;~/.gryphel/mnvm_rom&rdquo;, instead of after, to matchthe behavior of the other ports. This makes it easier to have a ROMimage for general use, and still be able try out another ROMimage.</p><p> * The autoscroll feature (used in full screen mode when theemulated screen size is larger than the real screen) wouldnot work when the emulation was stopped (using the&ldquo;Stopped toggle&rdquo; in the &ldquo;S&rdquo; command of theControl Mode). </p><p> * In the Cocoa port, Mini vMac would fail to mount a diskimage located on a file system that doesn't support locking.It now checks the result from the flock call, and only preventsmounting if the file is already locked, and doesn't preventmounting for other errors.</p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The hack allowing the emulated Mac Plus (and other models without Color Quickdraw)to have a larger screen always allocated enough memory for a screen with up to1048576 pixels. It now allocates more closely to just the memory needed, andcan handle screens up to 2097152 pixels (the size of the unused area in the addressspace that is used by this hack). I believe the previous limitation was mostlyconsequence of how earlier versions handled memory access in the CPU emulator.The build system will now give an error when the requested screen size containsmore than 2097152 pixels (before it would compile fine and just not work right).</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sss">-sss</a>&rdquo;selects the output Sound Sample Size.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_cbt">-cbt</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of Caret Blink Time(Rate of Insertion Point Blinking) in the Parameter RAM.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_dct">-dct</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of Double Click Timein the Parameter RAM.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_mnb">-mnb</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of Menu Blinksin the Parameter RAM.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_kyt">-kyt</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of Keyboard Repeat Thresholdin the Parameter RAM.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_kyr">-kyr</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of Keyboard Repeat Ratein the Parameter RAM.</p><p> * A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_svl">-svl</a>&rdquo;selects the initial value of the Sound Volume in the Parameter RAM.</p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!-- --><p> * None Yet. </p><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Sound in the Macintosh II emulation is much improved. Thebuild system now enables it by default.</p><p> * The Windows version wouldn't compile with magnification disabled(<a href="../options.html#option_magnify">-mf 1</a>) and screen depth(<a href="../options.html#option_depth">-depth</a>) of thousands,millions, or 4 colors.</p><p> * The Classic Mac versions(&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_t">-t m68k</a>&rdquo; and&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_t">-t mppc</a>&rdquo;)didn't always request a large enough memory allocation in theSIZE resource, particulary for large screen sizes and colordepths. The build system now tries to compute the memoryrequirements more exactly.</p><p> * The Pocket PC version wouldn't compile with"<a href="../options.html#option_im">-im 1</a>". Removingthe call to GetShortPathName for Pocket PC allows itto compile, but then registration won't workif the path of the application contains spaces.Upon further investigation, it seems all that is neededis to put the application path in quotes when settingregistry entries, so GetShortPathName isn't needed.So have made this change for both Pocket PC andthe regular Windows version.</p><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p> <!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p>* The build system now supports Xcode 6.3.2(with &ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_ev">-ev 6320</a>&rdquo;),and also Xcode 6.4 Beta (&ldquo;-ev 6400&rdquo;),Xcode 6.2 (&ldquo;-ev 6200&rdquo;),and Xcode 4.6.3 (&ldquo;-ev 4630&rdquo;).Though not tested,other versions of Xcode in between should also work, by constructingthe &ldquo;-ev&rdquo; option in the same way.</p><p>* The build system now supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2013(with &ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_ev">-ev 12000</a>&rdquo;),and also Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 (&ldquo;-ev 11000&rdquo;),and Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 RC (&ldquo;-ev 14000&rdquo;).</p><p>* Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_api">-api sd2</a>&rdquo;to use the<a href="http://www.libsdl.org">Simple DirectMedia Layer</a>2.0 API (the older 1.2 API was previously supported), based upon a<a href="https://github.com/vanfanel/minivmac_sdl2">port by Manuel Alfayate</a>,after this<a href="http://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=8807">discussion</a>.</p><p> * Files can now be dropped onto the build systemapplication icon. This is equivalent to copying thecontents of the file, and pasting it into the buildsystem window after removing any existing text(such as by the &lsquo;Select All&rsquo; and &lsquo;Clear&rsquo; commands),and then choosing the &lsquo;Go&rsquo; command. Multiple filescan be dropped, and they will be all beprocessed. (Though if there is an error, that erroris reported, and all remaining files are forgotten.)If the build system application was not yet runningwhen icons are dropped on it, then the applicationautomatically quits after processing all the files.Other ways of generating kAEOpenDocuments apple events,besides dropping files on the application icon,should also work, such as AppleScript.</p><p> * The Build System now supports drag and drop (whenthe drag and drop operating system software is present)onto its window, which has equivalent function to droppinga file on the application icon as described above.</p><p> * The Build System has a new &ldquo;Import&rdquo; commandin the File menu, which has equivalent function to droppinga file on the application icon as described above.</p><p> * The Build System has a new &ldquo;Export&rdquo; commandin the File menu, which saves the window&rsquo;s contentsto a new file, that the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; command canread. The new file has the creator set to the Build System,so double clicking on the file will work. The Build Systemapplication defines an icon for the files it saves.</p><p> * The Build System now has a progress indicator atthe bottom of the window. It can display informationabout what is going on. Clicking on the progressindicator is equivalent to choosing the &ldquo;Go&rdquo; commandfrom the File menu. The Build System can now potentially allowthe user interface to remain functional while processing. Butcalls have to be added to the processing code to allow this,calls that report progress and can yield time to the userinterface code.</p><p> * Renamed the Build System application to include branchinformation - "MnvM_b34". This makes it easier to deal withthe Stable and Development branches at the same time.</p><p> * Prevent warning about unused code when using options"-var-fullscreen 0 -fullscreen 1 -mf 1".</p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_t">-t fbpc</a>&rdquo;for FreeBSD on PowerPC. </p><p> * Added build system option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_cpu">-cpu</a>&rdquo;,to provide a starting point for compiling a combination ofoperating system and CPU that is not yet supported.</p><p> * The Build System now generates a compile time checkin a configuration file when compiling with gcc forx86-64 or x86-32, to make sure the 64 bit configurationis not compiled with a 32 bit compiler, or vice versa.This can result (especially when used with"<a href="../develop.html#option_no_asm">-no-asm</a>"),in a binary that almost but doesn't quite work correctly.The check is for the wrong predefine being present, rather thanchecking that the correct predefine exists, to reducethe chance of incorrectly giving an error on anunusual compiler version.</p><p> * It does not make sense to combine the build options&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_magnify">-magnify 1</a>&rdquo;(to start with magnification on)and&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_magnify">-mf 1</a>&rdquo;(to disable magnification),and the Build System now prevents this.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../index.html"><img src="../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v3.4- <a href="../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
