This helps to preserve the batteryon portable computers. </p><p> If the user types, or clicks or moves the mouse, or the emulatedcomputer draws to the screen, or reads or writes to an emulated disk,that counts as activity that prevents AutoSlow. </p><p> AutoSlow takes effect after either 0.5 seconds of emulated computertime, or 16 seconds worth of emulated instructions executed (usually about 2seconds at the default 8x speed), which ever is longer. </p><p> It is possible that some software will not draw anything to the screenfor longer than that while doing real work, so the AutoSlow featurecan be disabled with Control-S-W. Also, the compile time option '-as 0'causes Mini vMac to start with AutoSlow disabled. </p><p> A blinking insertion point will not prevent AutoSlow. This requiredimproving the code for detecting how much of the emulated screen was changed.This makes Mini vMac more efficient in general, since transferingimages to the real screen tends to be expensive.Previously it would detect that areas at the top and bottom of the emulatedscreen hadn't changed, to limit the amount of drawing to the real screen.Now it can detect that areas at the left and right of the emulated screenhaven't changed. If the remaining area that has changed is only a singlepixel wide and less than 32 pixels tall, it is assumed to be only a blinkinginsertion point, that doesn't prevent AutoSlow. </p><p> <a name="modified"> <b> Changed behavior in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Have begun making tweaked assembly version of 68000 emulationfor Intel x86 computers (starting from assembly language generated by gcc).This makes Mini vMac faster, as well as givingmore consistent results when Mini vMac is compiled with differentdevelopment environments. (Had previously only made tweaked assemblylanguage for PowerPC computers.)</p><p>* Improved accuracy of timing. Mini vMac now measures time in cyclesrather than instructions executed. In the simplest form, all instructionsare assumed to take the same number of cycles, and this closely matchesthe results of previous versions of Mini vMac. (Mini vMac actually countssixty fourth cycles, not just integer number of cycles, so that averagetimes of instructions can be more accurate.) But by default, Mini vMacnow assigns an average number of cycles for each of the 65536 primary opcodes.</p><p> As a compile time option, in addition to using the table, Mini vMac cantry to compute more accurate cycles for certain instructions, dependingon the current data. This is slower, and only implemented in the C versionof the 68000 emulation, making it slower still. </p><p> The build system option "-ta 0" selects the least accurate of these three methods,the default is "-ta 1", and "-ta 2" selects the most accurate. </p><p> The most accurate option is still not completely accurate. Completely accuratetiming would be exceedingly difficult. For example, the CPU and video outputconflict for accesses to RAM, and that would seem very complex to model. </p><p> The greater accuracy is so far mostly theoretical. The timings wereentered from Motorola documentation. It needs to be tested and calibratedby comparing to real hardware. Currently 68000 timings are used even inthe 68020 emulation. More accurate timing for 68020 should be added in afuture version. Truly accurate timing for 68020 would be much more difficultthan for the 68000 because of pipelining and caching, probably to the pointof being unfeasible for Mini vMac. But more accurate averages should be possible.</p><p> * Mini vMac will now by default mount disk images in Disk Copy 4.2 formatas read only. This is because by default Mini vMac ignores the checksum andtags of this format, so writing to the image makes it invalid. Mini vMac canbe compiled with full support for this format, in which case the images willbe writable. </p><p> The new utility<a href="../extras/cnvtdc42/index.html">CnvtDC42</a>converts Disk Copy 4.2 format images to a newimage without the tags and checksums, that the default version of Mini vMaccan write to.</p><p> * The Windows and Linux versions now match a previous feature of theMacintosh versions. When switching from full screen to normal mode,or toggling magnification in normal mode, it will preserve the emulatedcursor position, by moving the host computer's cursor.</p><p> * As an additional safety feature, the control mode confirmation forthe reset, interrupt, and quit commands will now treat anything other than'y' as meaning no, rather than ignoring it. (With exception that a repeatedkey is ignored - so 'q' is ignored for quit, 'r' for reset, and 'i' forinterrupt.) This is because I once managed to accidentally reset Mini vMacby typing unintentionally into control mode.</p><p> * The power button can now be used in the OS X version when in fullscreen mode, to put the (real) computer to sleep.</p><p> * I've rearranged the Mini vMac about page (Control-A) a bit to makeroom for another idea I have for the variations. It no longer displayswhich computer is being emulated. That can be inferred from thevariation number.</p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * In OS X, changing the screen configuration, such as switchingbetween using the internal screen of a MacBook Air and an external screen,would tend to make Mini vMac stop drawing.</p><p> * In OS X, if the screen configuration changes when in full screen mode,Mini vMac will turn off full screen mode, instead of just leaving the emulatorwindow at a size that is now wrong.</p><p> * In OS X, may now have a viable work around formisbehavior of the operating system calls to hide and show thecursor. The most easily reproducible such situation was when thecomputer went to sleep and then wakes up, the real cursorwould end up visible.</p><p> * In OS X, the operating system can sometimes bring up a dialog, suchas for force quit (upon command-option-escape), and Mini vMac wouldn'tnotice, leaving the real cursor hidden, making the dialog hardto use. </p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The build system option, "-emm 0", disables the more accurate mouse emulationnormally used in full screen mode. This allows Mini vMac to work somewhat better ontablet computers without a mouse. But such computers are still not really supported.</p><p> * The build system option, "-var-fullscreen 0", makes the full screen mode optiona constant rather than a variable. So "-var-fullscreen 0 -fullscreen 1" will makeMini vMac always run in full screen mode, and "-var-fullscreen 0 -fullscreen 0" willmake Mini vMac never run in full screen mode. The "F" control mode command disappears.</p><p> * The build system option "-log" enables improved logging infrastructure fordebugging in Mini vMac. It can now write out megabytes of information per second toa log file without bogging down the emulation too much. (On a modern machine.)But nothing much will happen without further enabling or creating code to logvarious events that you are currently interested in. This is for developers only.</p><p> * The build system option "-dis" enables a disassembler built into the emulator.Besides disassembling a number of instructions executed after an event of interest,it can disassemble instructions prior to the event, as the emulator can savethe addresses of instruction executed to a circular buffer.Requires the "-log" option. Nothing much will happen without further enablingor creating code to log various events that you are currently interested in.This is for developers only. </p><p> * The build system option "-intl" forces Mini vMac to supportinternational characters in the user interface, even when using thedefault English. This is useful if the maintainer name needsthe extra characters. (It would be nicer for the build systemto figure out for itself what character set is needed. Butthis will do for now.) </p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><p> * None Yet. </p><!----><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * Improved FPU emulation, originally written for Mini vMacby Ross Martin. This code was modified touse SoftFloat, by John Hauser (as found used in the Bochs emulator),plus some extensions to SoftFloat by Stanislav Shwartsman(also found in Bochs).Though using SoftFloat is slower than using native floating point,it ensures consistent results on different computers,and makes it easier to compile with different development environments.There's still a lot of work to do on the FPU emulation, but it alreadyallows much more software for the Mac II to run without crashing. </p><p> * In many cases the Macintosh II emulation can now emit sound that isrecognizably related to how it is supposed to. It's not perfect yet,and due to the nature of sound that means it not really yet usable at all.But it is significant progress. </p><p> * The Macintosh II emulation supports more than 1M of video ram in24 bit addressing. (One noticable effect is that allows identifydisplays button in monitors control panel to work.)</p><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p> <!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> * The build system and the extras are easier to compile with differentMacintosh 680x0 C compilers.</p><p> * The build system now supports the Digital Mars Compiler (with "-t wx86 -e dmc")and the Pelles C Compiler (with "-t wx86 -e plc" and "-t wx86 -e plc -cl").</p><p> * The build system now supports XCode 4.0.2 (with "-ev 4000"). </p><p> * There is better support in general for different versions of MicrosoftVisual Studio. Specifically, support has been added forVisual Studio 2010 (with "-ev 10000"), Visual Studio .NET 2003(with "-ev 7100"), and Visual Studio .NET 2002 (with "-ev 7000").</p><p> * There is a new build system option, "-t lx64", to target for 64 bit Linux.And there is a new option, "-t wx64", to target for 64 bit Windows.Both would currently be slower than the 32 bit versions, because those versionsnow have some assembly language tweaking.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../index.html"><img src="../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v3.2- <a href="../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2011 Paul C.
