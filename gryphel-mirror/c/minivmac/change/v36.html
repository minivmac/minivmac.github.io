If using it as you would previouslywould behave differently, that is "changed behavior". --><!--<p> * None Yet. </p></p>--><p> *The new &lsquo;P&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="../control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>copies to the clipboard (of the real computer, not the emulatedcomputer) a string containing the options describing thisvariation of Mini vMac.</p><p> *If the ROM image is not found in any of the locations that Mini vMaclooks, the error can now be recovered from. You can drag the ROM imageonto Mini vMac, and booting will resume. (Any of the methods that wouldnormally mount a disk image will work to get the ROM, such as the Opendialog.)</p><p> *The Cocoa version for OS X now looks for the ROM image in oneadditional place,&ldquo;/Library/Application Support/Gryphel/mnvm_rom/&rdquo;,which can be read by a Sandboxed application. To change&ldquo;/Library/&rdquo;, an administrative account is needed.(Sandboxing is off by default, there is a new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sbx">-sbx 1</a>&rdquo;,to enable Sandboxing.)</p><p> <a name="modified"> <b> Changed behavior in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *The version numbering scheme has changed. Instead of&ldquo;3.6.4&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;36.04&rdquo;. The distinction betweenmajor and minor version numbers has not been useful. Instead there isnow a single branch number. This allows more bug fix releases (up to 99instead of up to 9) without taking more space in the version string.</p><p> *The Cocoa version for OS X is now normally signed with a certificatefrom Apple, so that the Gatekeeper feature of OS X will permit it torun by default. This was not done before because of some issues,and because those issues are still there, there is a new build systemoption &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sgn">-sgn 0</a>&rdquo;to disable code signing.</p><p> *The URL in the Mini vMac about message is now the main Gryphel Projectpage, rather than the Mini vMac page, mostly since it is shorter, incase anyone tries to type it in from here.</p><p> *In the help screen (Control-H), and also the speed control screen(Control-S), there is now a single space after the letters onthe left instead of two.</p><p> *Mini vMac will no longer display &ldquo;Abnormal Situation&rdquo;reports, by default. There is a new build systemoption &ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_abr">-abr 1</a>&rdquo;to enable them.</p><p> <a name="bugs"> <b> Bug fixes in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *Using Macsbug to step through code (with Command-S or Command-T) did notwork properly in Mini vMac 3.5.x. An optimization to the main cpuemulation loop was not valid when the trace flag gets set, so theinterrupt could happen one instruction later. I found a way to fix itwhich doesn&rsquo;t change the optimized main loop, but just the codebefore and after. But it can change the timing of other kinds ofinterrupts by one instruction, potentially causing subtle differences inbehavior anywhere.</p><!--(This code has been disabled)<p> *The OS X Cocoa port now tries to work around Apple&rsquo;sPath Randomization misfeature added in macOS Sierra (10.12).If an application that Apple thinks is trustworthy is bundledtogether with malicious library code in the same folder, themalicious code may be run by the application. The silly way that Applehas chosen to prevent this is to in effect move the applicationsomewhere else before running it, so it can&rsquo;t find the librarycode. It can&rsquo;t find anything else in the application&rsquo;sfolder either, which is a problem for Mini vMac, which looks for thingsin its folder, such as the ROM image file. So now the Cocoa portof Mini vMac will try to find the original location of theapplication, and use that instead of the location it is running from,when looking for the ROM image and other things.(Mini vMac doesn&rsquo;t look for external library code,so Path Randomization has no benefit.)This is doneusing some undocumented SecTranslocate calls as suggested by&ldquo;<a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x15.html">Objective-See</a>&rdquo;and<a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/detect-app-translocation.html">Jeff Johnson</a>.</p>--><p> *On a Retina screen in OS X, the window frame of Mini vMac wouldbe drawn in low resolution. The Cocoa port now adds thekey NSHighResolutionCapable to the Info.plist file, whichseems to fix this. Thanks to Ryan for<a href="../../mail/v8.html#m86">this fix</a>.</p><p> *A memory leak is fixed in the Cocoa port for OS X, when exporting theclipboard. This was found by the Xcode Analyze feature.</p><p> *On Windows, if Num Lock is on,the operating passes virtual key codes like VK_NUMPAD0 throughVK_NUMPAD9, but if Num Lock is off, it passes virtual key codes likeVK_LEFT, VK_RIGHT, VK_UP, and VK_DOWN. A flag bit indicates whetherVK_LEFT means the left arrow key or the 4 key on the keypad. Sonow Mini vMac will check that flag, and map the keys on the keypadto the emulated Macintosh keypad, regardless of whether Num Lockis on. (But this doesn&rsquo;t fully explain the reported issue.)</p><p> <a name="compile_feature"> <b> New features not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lang">-lang cat</a>&rdquo;selects a Catalan translation of the user interface byArduinoXino.</p><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lang">-lang cze</a>&rdquo;selects a Czech translation of the user interface byAnonymous.</p><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_lang">-lang srl</a>&rdquo;selects a Serbian translation of the user interface bySerbXenomorph.</p><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sgn">-sgn 0</a>&rdquo;,for the Cocoa version for OS X, to disable code signing.</p><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_sbx">-sbx 1</a>&rdquo;,for the Cocoa version for OS X, to enable Sandboxing.</p><p> *A new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_gse">-gse 1</a>&rdquo;,for the Cocoa version for OS X, which on computers with more thanone GPU allows the operating system to change which one is used.Otherwise on a MacBook pro,<a href="../../mail/v8.html#m89">it is reported</a> thatthe higher power discrete GPU is always used instead of thelower power integrated GPU, and that besides wasting power for nonoticable benefit, it also takes time to switch on the discrete GPUwhen Mini vMac starts.&ldquo;-gse 1&rdquo; should probably become the default in thefuture. But I don&rsquo;t have a MacBook pro to test it on, andI have a few questions about it.</p><p> * New build system options&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_hc">-hcr, -hcg, and -hcb</a>&rdquo;select the initial value of red, green, and blue componentsof the highlight color in the Parameter RAM. The&ldquo;<a href="../extras/getpram/index.html">GetPRAM</a>&rdquo;tool can be used to get values for these options.This was<a href="../../mail/v5.html#m38">requested</a>by Karl.</p><p> * New build system options&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_alc">-alc, -lcy, and -lcx</a>&rdquo;allow manually setting the location fieldsin the Parameter RAM. The&ldquo;<a href="../extras/getpram/index.html">GetPRAM</a>&rdquo;tool can be used to get values for these options.</p><p> * New build system options&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_atz">-atz, -lcd, -lczs, and -lcz</a>&rdquo;allow manually setting the time zone fieldsin the Parameter RAM. The&ldquo;<a href="../extras/getpram/index.html">GetPRAM</a>&rdquo;tool can be used to get values for these options.</p><p> *The new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_km">-km</a>&rdquo;changes the mapping between keys on the real Keyboard and keys onthe emulated Keyboard, or the Mini vMac Control Mode.</p><p> *The new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_ekt">-ekt &lt;dst&gt;</a>&rdquo;chooses which emulated key is toggled bythe &lsquo;K&rsquo; command of the Mini vMacControl Mode.</p><p> *The new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_svd">-svd 0</a>&rdquo;disables the save dialog for OS X and Windows when exporting afile (as used by the Mini vMac extra<a href="../extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>and other tools). Instead the exported file is saved in a foldernamed &ldquo;out&rdquo; without a dialog, as was previously donein the Linux version. This makes it easier to run Mini vMacin an automated script and get results out.</p><p> *The new build system option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_iid">-iid 1</a>&rdquo;enables an Insert Ith Disk Image feature.When this feature is enabled, if the Control key is held downand a number key from &lsquo;1&rsquo; to &lsquo;9&rsquo; is pressed,then Mini vMac will try to mount a disk image named from "disk1.dsk" to"disk9.dsk" in the folder containing the application.</p><p>This is the same series of disk image names that are automaticallymounted when Mini vMac is launched. But it stops at the firstimage not found. So if you leave a name unused, then you canuse a control-number key to mount disks after launch. Or, youcan use a control-number key to remount a disk that was automaticallymounted at launch and then later ejected.</p><p>One example use is if you have one copy of Mini vMac runninga development environment (such as MPW) that is used to compilea program to a disk image. The disk image is then unmountedand mounted on another copy of Mini vMac running a testingenvironment. If the compiled program crashes badly, thedevelopment environment is not disturbed. The control-number keyfeature makes it easier to move the disk image backand forth between the two copies of Mini vMac.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_eci">-eci 0</a>&rdquo;disables the &lsquo;I&rsquo; command of the Mini vMacControl Mode,which presses the emulated Interrupt Button.In a future version, it may be disabled by default.(In the original Macintosh, the Interrupt Button was disabledby default. You needed to install the&ldquo;Programmer&rsquo;s Switch&rdquo; to use it.)</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_ecr">-ecr 0</a>&rdquo;disables the &lsquo;R&rsquo; command of the Mini vMacControl Mode,which presses the emulated Reset Button.In a future version, it may be disabled by default.(In the original Macintosh, the Reset Button was disabledby default. You needed to install the&ldquo;Programmer&rsquo;s Switch&rdquo; to use it.)</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_eck">-eck 0</a>&rdquo;disables the &lsquo;K&rsquo; command of the Mini vMacControl Mode,which toggles the emulated control key.In a future version, it may be disabled by default.(The original Macintosh did not have a control key. And, usingthis command accidently would be confusing.)</p><p> <a name="compile_modified"> <b> Changed behavior not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!----><p> * None Yet. </p><p> <a name="compile_bugs"> <b> Bug fixes not in default compile </b> </a> </p><!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><p> *The game PowerMonger was<a href="../../mail/v8.html#m109">reported</a>not to work in Mini vMac 3.5.8, though it worked in 3.4.1.This was due to a bug in emulating the TRAPcc instructionin the Macintosh II emulation.</p><p> *If debug logging was turned on for the classic Macintosh port,and the log already existed when Mini vMac started, thelog wasn&rsquo;t cleared.</p><p> <a name="build"> <b> Build System </b> </a> </p> <!--<p> * None Yet. </p>--><!--<p> *The user interface of the build system is updated. It now implementsUndo. There are commands to Cut/Copy/Paste using the Host Clipboard.It fixes an issue with autoscroll. A blinking busy indicator isimplemented.</p>--><p> *The build system is now a cross platform standard C command line tool togenerate a script to write configuration files, as was done prior toMini vMac 3, instead of a 68k Macintosh program to generate files tocompile. This should allow the Variations Service to be more efficient,and is also more convenient for experienced programmers. The trade offis in making it harder for others to compile their own variations.</p><p> *The default version of XCode chosen by the buildsystem is now 9.4.1, the latest version supported. Since XCode is nolonger used for official Mini vMac builds, there is no reason to defaultto the specific antique version previously used. Similarly,Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 is now the default version chosen forthat development environment.</p><p> *Due to a compiler bug in Microsoft Visual Studio 2017,optimizations are turned off for this development environment.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_br">-br</a>&rdquo;is for future use and currently has no effect.It tells the build system that the requested options were from aspecific branch (version) of Mini vMac.The new &lsquo;P&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="../control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>gets the options from an existing variation, andincludes this Branch setting. If the defaultsettings have changed from since that older version,then the build system will use defaults of the old version,rather than the current defaults. So the newly generatedvariation behaves as close as possible to the earliervariation.</p><p>The &lsquo;P&rsquo; command retrieves the options in acanonical form. It always generates a &ldquo;-br&rdquo;option for the current version, rather than copyingany &ldquo;-br&rdquo; option passed to the build system.</p><p> *If the new option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_at">@</a>&rdquo;is used, no developer options are permitted to the right ofit. This will allow the Variations Service to allow theuser to specify options as text without the chance of breakingthe service. </p><!--<p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_no_src">-no-src 1</a>&rdquo;causes the build systemto only generate the configuration files and not save the sourcefiles.When the options&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_cfg">-cfg 1</a>&rdquo;and&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_all_src">-all-src 1</a>&rdquo;are used together, the generated source folder is identical forall variations. So it could save time to not generate itfor every variation.</p>--><!--<p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../develop.html#option_ef">-ef 1</a>&rdquo;causes the build system to write error messages toa text file, instead of displaying an alert dialog. This will allowthe Variations Service to allow the user to specify options as text,and get any error messages, such as about bad syntax, back to the webpage shown to the user, rather than breaking the service. </p>--><!--<p> *When the build system is told to write error messages to a fileand quit when finished, there is no chance to select the textof where the error was found. So error messages have been changed toalways include the name of the option with the problem. Thisallows the Advanced Variations Service to give more useful errors.</p>--><p> *If the new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_xclm">!</a>&rdquo;is used, options to the right of it will override options to the leftof it. Normally it would be an error for the same option tobe used twice. It is still an error foran option to be used twice on the same side of &lsquo;!&rsquo;.</p><p> *The new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_cte">-cte 1</a>&rdquo;causes the build system to generate sourcecode that causes the compiler to generate an error. Thisis for testing the variation service. </p><p> *If the new option&ldquo;<a href="../options.html#option_bte">-bte</a>&rdquo;is used, the build system will treat it asan error. This is for testing the variation service.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../index.html"><img src="../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Back up to - <b><a href="index.html">Changes in Mini vMac versions</a></b></p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/<a href="index.html">change</a>/v36- <a href="../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2018 Paul C.
