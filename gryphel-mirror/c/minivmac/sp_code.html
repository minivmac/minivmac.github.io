It consists ofnumbers and one underscore, something like &ldquo;1234567_1234&rdquo;.</p><p>Subscriber Codes are available through the e-commercecompany FastSpring:</p><blockquote>	<p>	<a href="https://gryphel.onfastspring.com/subscriber-code">Purchase Subscriber Code with FastSpring</a>	</p></blockquote><p>The price is ten dollars (plus tax), which helps to supportthe operation of the Gryphel Project. Immediately after purchase,the page displays a Subscriber Code in red letters.(The Subscriber Code is also emailed to you.) </p><p>To use a Subscriber Code, paste it into the Subscriber Code fieldnear the top of the<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac Variations Service</a>form, and a regular variation will be created instead of a demo.A regular version is identical to a demo, except for not having theword &ldquo;Demo&rdquo; float around the emulated screen. Youcan make as many copies as you want, and give them to anyone,under the GNU General Public License (GPL).</p><p>An alternative way to obtain a Subscriber Code is to make a<a href="../wishlist/index.html">donation to the Gryphel Project</a>of ten dollars or more. I will then email the code to you.It usually takes at least a few hours (I receive notification of adonation when I check my email). Unfortunately, email is not alwaysreliable. If you don&rsquo;t receive it within a couple days,first check your spam folder. If it is not there, then contact meusing the <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> form,giving your name, the email address on your donation, and adifferent email address (and/or street address to mail a letter).</p><h4> Some fine print </h4><p><a name="asterisk"><b>*</b></a>A Subscriber Code code can be used to request up to 25 variationseach day, every day for a year.</p><p>The Variations Service only promises to build variationsaccurately from the public Mini vMac source. No guarantee is madethat the built variations are suitable for any purpose.(Please <a href="../feedback.html">report any bugs</a>.)It is possible that some variations can not be built at all due tobugs in the Mini vMac source. Otherwise, requested variations will bebuilt eventually, but there is no guarantee of how long it will take,due to hardware failures and such issues. </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/sp_code- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
