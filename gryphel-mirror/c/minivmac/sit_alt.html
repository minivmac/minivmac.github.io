But the currentversion no longer supports uncompressing this archive. If you canfind an old enough version of Stuffit Expander, that can work.</p><p> Or, you can use an old Macintosh to expand it (i.e. suchas your Macintosh Plus.)The file &ldquo;SSW_6.0.8-1.4MB_Disk1of2.sea.bin&rdquo;contains a Macintosh file encodedin MacBinary format, preserving Macintosh specific information.You can use a program such as"<a href="extras/binunpk/index.html">binUnpk</a>" toextract the program &ldquo;SSW 6.0.8-1.4MB Disk1of2.sea&rdquo;.This program is a Stuffit Self Extracting Archive. Running iton an old Macintosh will get a disk imagefile named &ldquo;System Startup&rdquo;. </p><p> Instead of a real Macintosh, you can use the program Executor,which can run some 680x0 Macintosh software withoutrequiring any software from Apple. Though it is nolonger developed or supported, it currently may be downloaded for free.It comes with StuffIt Expander 4.0.1 which can extractthe program &ldquo;SSW 6.0.8-1.4MB Disk1of2.sea&rdquo; from&ldquo;SSW_6.0.8-1.4MB_Disk1of2.sea.bin&rdquo;, and then&ldquo;SSW 6.0.8-1.4MB Disk1of2.sea&rdquo; can be run toget the disk image &ldquo;System Startup&rdquo;. </p><p> If you happen to have any sort of disk image that can bootMini vMac (i.e. containing system 7.5.5 or earlier), thenyou can use Mini vMac to extract the archive, to geta clean copy of official Apple system software. Youwill need a large enough blank disk image (see&ldquo;<a href="extras/blanks/index.html">Blanks</a>&rdquo;),<a href="extras/importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a> to import the '.bin' file,<a href="extras/binunpk/index.html">binUnpk</a> to decode the '.bin' file(to get the '.sea' file that you run), and<a href="extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a> to get the extracted disk image back tothe host computer. </p><p> &ldquo;Samir&rdquo; points out that<a href="https://theunarchiver.com/">The Unarchiver</a>,a free and open source utility for OS X,&ldquo;can extract .sea files as well as .bin files and a lotof other archive formats&rdquo;. ua608d descends fromthe command line version of The Unarchiver.</p><p> &ldquo;Bjoern&rdquo; points out another alternative for Intel Macs.<a href="../sw/system/sys70/index.html">System 7.0.1</a>is available from Apple in '.smi.bin' format. '.bin' can bedecoded by any Mac version of StuffIt Expander, and probablyother programs as well. This results in an '.smi' file that canbe opened in OS X, mounting a disk image that contains 6disk images that can be used in Mini vMac. </p><p> Previous versions of the getting started page recommended using&ldquo;<a href="../sw/system/sys60/index.html">SSW_6.0.8-800k_Disk1of4.sea.bin</a>&rdquo; through&ldquo;SSW_6.0.8-800k_Disk4of4.sea.bin&rdquo;, which havethe same system 6.0.8 software, and which are alsoavailable from the Apple.Thanks to Ryan Schmidt for pointing out that these 800k diskimages are packaged as<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiskDoubler">DiskDoubler</a>Self Extracting Archives, which can not be expandedwith Stuffit Expander, while the 1.4MB disk imagesare packaged as Stuffit Self Extracting Archives, andcan be.The 1.4MB images can not be used with a real Mac Plus,but the emulated Mac Plus of Mini vMac can use them, becauseof the replacement disk driver. </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/sit_alt- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
