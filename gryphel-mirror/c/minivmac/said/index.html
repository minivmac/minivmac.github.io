Thanks for all your amazingwork!</p> </blockquote><p> Mon, Apr 18 2016 </p><blockquote> <p>[...] Anyway, thanks a lot for your work, it was really fun to be ableto play with my children to Lode Runner in all its glory!</p> </blockquote><p> Wed, Apr  6 2016 </p><blockquote> <p>Hi, I&rsquo;ve been a user of Mini vMac for about 9-10 years now, andenjoyed every moment of using it. [...]</p> </blockquote><p> Tue, 14 May 2013 </p><blockquote><p> mini vMac is really amazing. I am one of the originaldevelopers of After Dark, and I was able to run After Dark,and THINK C 5.0 inside Mini vMac on a modern Retina MBP withvery little fuss. It's fast! </p> </blockquote><p> Wed, 22 Feb 2012 </p><blockquote><p> I can't express enough to you how nice it has been to beable to take a step into the past and relive the old Macoperating system.  There's a staggering level of nostalgiahitting me that I can't describe every time I use youremulator, so I just wanted to thank you for taking care ofsuch an important part of my past. :-) </p> <p> Tim R. </p> </blockquote><p> Tue, 7 Feb 2012 </p><blockquote><p> [...] a word of thanks to you for your continued work onMini vMac. It is without question the best emulator I haveever seen. </p> <p> John </p> </blockquote><p> Sat, 19 Nov 2011 </p><blockquote><p> I was so amazed to find that mini vmac ran under Lion and sodoes (apparently) my Mac program that I wrote in 1991!! </p> <p> Thanks so much for allowing me to retain this part of mylife (and useful functionality). </p> <p> Todd Katz </p> </blockquote><p> Sun, 8 Aug 2010 </p><blockquote><p> I was touched when, accompaniedby the well known ~SBeep~T,  the old familiar screen of myFat Mac appeared on my PC. It works beautifully. Even thescientific programmes I wrote in the programming languageBasic on the Fat Mac perform very well in the mini Vmac. TheMini VMac is fast, reliable and good. </p> <p> Christ Schreurs </p> </blockquote><p> Sat, 12 Dec 2009 </p><blockquote><p> I just wanted to say thanks for keeping the firesburning on this project.  These days, since I have moved to64-bit Windows 7 as my primary OS, Mini vMac is the ONLY Macemulator I've been to run at any level of stability on myWin7 systems.  So, your effort is much appreciated, becauseI have to have my Mac fix now and then! </p> <p> James </p> </blockquote><p> Sat, 10 Dec 2009 </p><blockquote><p> [...] love the program ... it has been INVALUABLE to me ... havebeen able to update edit &amp; update files I've had stored for20+ years </p><p> Jon </p> </blockquote><p> Fri, 6 Nov 2009 </p><blockquote><p> I tried Mini vMac on Windows 7 64bit Ultimate, it works well and it's so cute! I can show my kids howmy first ever computer, a Mac Plus of course, looked like with its 9 inches black and white screen...memories!<br> Thanks for this great job, </p> <p> Laurent </p> </blockquote><p> Fri, 30 Oct 2009 </p><blockquote><p> This emulator is incredible. I had reduced expectations from priorexperience with emulators, but this one is amazing. I was up and runningand playing games I haven't seen in decades in no time at all. Great job! </p> </blockquote><p> Thu, 11 Jun 2009 </p><blockquote><p> I wanted to let you know that I've submitted a payment atKagi. I've been doing custom builds of Mini vMac for sometime, so I am not really in need of keys for your builds.However, I am incredibly pleased with how nicely Mini vMacworks. Most impressive is the video/audio/mouse. Generally,emulators tend to feel a bit laggy/sluggish when it comes toinput and they tend to not scale very well to the hostscreen resolution (not all, but a good portion). Mini vMac,however, is superbly done and full screen is just awesome. </p> <p> Thank you for the work on this, I am enjoying using an SEagain :) </p> <p> Cheers, </p> <p> John </p></blockquote><p> Sun, 10 May 2009 </p><blockquote><p> [...] And thanks again for the great program. I spent a lot of time messing aroundwith those little black and white computers when I was little, and it meansa lot to be able to go back and relive some of that again. :)<br>-Jacob </p></blockquote><p> Tue, 26 May 2009 </p><blockquote><p> MiniVMAC is great! Playing Dark Castle is just awesome, andit's a nive, light and fast emulator, ver well optimizedtoo. [...] </p><p> Manuel </p></blockquote><p> Sun, 2 Mar 2008 </p><blockquote><p> haven't even tried out the mac emulator yet, but wanted youto know clicking around on your site is a pleasure.  nocrap.  just quality content.  thanks. </p></blockquote><p> Sun, 25 Nov 2007 </p><blockquote><p> Your program is a miracle!  I thought I was never going tosee my MindWrite word processor ever again.  My 1992PowerBook 180 has just expired, and I doubt I will be ableto revive it. </p><p> I have donated $25 to keep your spirits up!  MiniVMacreally has been a miracle for me.  I am now able to look atall my old correspondence again, back to 1984.  Wonderful. </p><p> I would very much like to 'break faith' with the 512 x 342screen size, though.  The last time I did any serious workwith my old software I had a Mac II, with a 1620 x 1260black and white screen, plus a colour monitor, at times.  Icould fit a 100 lines of code, top to bottom, and have 8 or9 different windows open in Think Pascal.  Do you have anyintention of extending the interface of the MacPlus? [Ahack for larger screen sizes is now a compile time option.]</p><p> Once again, thank you very much indeed -- I have gone allaround my college where I am studying computer software,showing off my old Mac, running on my new Mac!  It reallyis wonderful. </p><p> [...] </p><p> Duncan </p></blockquote><p> Fri, 20 Jul 2007 </p><blockquote><p> What a great discovery. I run it on my Windows XP notebook.Some of the old classic games and apps, back again! And Ihave rediscovered many of my old documents. Very cool.<br> Thanks a bunch! </p></blockquote><p> : </p><p> Next - <b><a href="../license.html">License</a></b> (GPL)</p><p> Or skip to - <b><a href="../download.html">Download Mini vMac</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../index.html">minivmac</a>/said- <a href="../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2013 Paul C.
