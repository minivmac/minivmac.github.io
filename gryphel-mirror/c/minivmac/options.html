(Emulation of the Floating Point Unit is the main incompletepart.) It does seem suitable for games, many of which appear to workperfectly well. </p><p> The Macintosh II emulation is not available on a Macintosh 680x0 target(&ldquo;-t m68k&rdquo;), because the compiler used doesn&rsquo;t support64 bit integers currently needed for FPU emulation.</p><p> Since a Macintosh II can be hard to find, the Macintosh IIemulator will accept the ROM from Macintosh IIx. TheMacintosh IIx ROM appears to work with Macintosh II hardware.The Macintosh IIcx, the Macintosh II FDHD,and the Macintosh SE/30 all have the same ROM as the Macintosh IIx. </p><p> <a name="option_xres"> <b> Screen Size </b> </a> </p><p> You can choose the emulated screen size with lines such as: </p><pre>-hres 640 { horizontal resolution }-vres 512 { vertical resolution }</pre><p> Mini vMac requires that the horizontal resolutionbe a multiple of 32. </p><p> For the Macintosh Plus, and other Macintosh computers withoutColor Quickdraw, this is a hack implemented with numerousROM patches. It emulates a computer that never existed, sothere will definitely be compatibility issues with some software.Also keep in mind that most games that will work on the Macintosh Plusare designed for 512x342, and don't benefit from a larger screen.You can also set the emulated screen smaller than 512x342, whichcould be useful on portable devices, but that will really causecompatibility issues. </p><p> For the Macintosh II emulation, these options specify theresolution of the external monitor, and shouldn't causecompatibility problems, at least if you choose values that were commonon real monitors of the era. On the other hand, the MacintoshII emulation is unfinished, and not really usable yet. </p><p> Some example screen sizes: </p><p> common old Macintosh screen sizes </p><pre>-hres 512 -vres 384 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0100.html">mnvm0100</a>) } -->-hres 640 -vres 480 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0101.html">mnvm0101</a>) } -->-hres 800 -vres 600 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0102.html">mnvm0102</a>) } -->-hres 1024 -vres 768 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0103.html">mnvm0103</a>) } --></pre><p> common current screen sizes, but divided by two, so can use Magnify in full screen </p><pre>-hres 512 -vres 384 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0100.html">mnvm0100</a>) --> half 1024 x 768 }-hres 640 -vres 400 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0110.html">mnvm0110</a>) --> half 1280 x 800 }-hres 640 -vres 512 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0111.html">mnvm0111</a>) --> half 1280 x 1024 }-hres 704 -vres 450 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0112.html">mnvm0112</a>) --> half 1440 x 900, width constrained }-hres 832 -vres 525 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0113.html">mnvm0113</a>) --> half 1680 x 1050, width constrained }-hres 960 -vres 540 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0114.html">mnvm0114</a>) --> half 1920 x 1080 }-hres 960 -vres 600 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0115.html">mnvm0115</a>) --> half 1920 x 1200 }</pre><p> Mini vMac allows up to 4 Megabytes of Video RAM in the MacintoshII emulation. Anything over 1 Megabyte requires a hack, sinceeach NuBus slot only gets 1 Megabyte of the address space in24 bit mode. Space from adjacent NuBus slots is given tothe emulated video card. </p><p> <a name="option_depth"> <b> Screen Depth </b> </a> </p><p> You can choose the emulated screen color depth with lines such as: </p><pre>-depth 0 { black and white }-depth 1 { 2 bit color (4 colors) }-depth 2 { 4 bit color (16 colors) }-depth 3 { 8 bit color (256 colors) (default for Mac II emulation) }-depth 4 { 16 bit color (thousands) }-depth 5 { 32 bit color (millions) }</pre><p>These options only work for Macintosh models that supportColor Quickdraw, which currently means Mac II emulation only.</p><p>To use thousands or millions of colors in System 6, you needto have 32-Bit QuickDraw, which is available from theSystem 6.0.8 installer, under Customize.</p><p> Color depth is a compile time option, insteadof run time option, to help keep Mini vMac simple andsmall. However, regardless of the chosen color depth,Black and White is also available, and canbe selected from the "Monitors" control panel.(In fact, you may not see color until selectingit from the "Monitors" control panel.) </p><p> <a name="option_fullscreen"> <b> Full Screen Mode </b> </a> </p><pre>-fullscreen 0 { (default) start with Full Screen Mode off }-fullscreen 1 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0162.html">mnvm0162</a>) --> start with Full Screen Mode on }</pre><pre>-var-fullscreen 0 { Full Screen Mode is constant }-var-fullscreen 1 { (default) Full Screen Mode is variable }</pre><p> "-var-fullscreen 0" combines with -fullscreen like so: </p><pre>-var-fullscreen 0 -fullscreen 0 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0163.html">mnvm0163</a>) --> Never run in Full Screen Mode }-var-fullscreen 0 -fullscreen 1 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0164.html">mnvm0164</a>) --> Always run in Full Screen Mode }</pre><p> In both cases, the "F" control mode command disappears. </p><p> <a name="option_magnify"> <b> Magnify </b> </a> </p><pre>-magnify 0 { (default) start with Magnify Mode off }-magnify 1 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0165.html">mnvm0165</a>) --> start with Magnify Mode on }</pre><p> The magnification factor can be changed: </p><pre>-mf 1 { disable magnification }-mf 2 { (default) 2x }-mf 3 { 3x }-mf 4 { 4x }...</pre><p> Disabling magnification with "-mf 1" removes the Control-M command. </p><p> <a name="option_sound"> <b> Sound </b> </a> </p><p> The Macintosh, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD versions have soundemulation on by default. The Dragonfly BSD and OpenIndiana version can be compiledwith sound, but this hasn't been tested. The OpenBSD version can becompiled with sound, but it doesn't work. (Other versions don't implement sound.)</p><pre>-sound 1 { Emulate sound }-sound 0 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0150.html">mnvm0150</a>) --> No sound emulation }</pre><p> One reason to disable sound is to avoid the Macintosh start up beep. Anotherreason is to get a few percent better performance. </p><p> <a name="option_sss"> <b> Sound Sample Size </b> </a> </p><pre>-sss 3 { (default) 8 bit sound }-sss 4 { 16 bit sound }</pre><p> A Macintosh Plus outputs 8 bit sound (256 possible levels),which is then modulated by the sound volume setting (8 possible levels),and also by the square wave generator. By default Mini vMaccurrently outputs 8 bit sound, but there is an option to output 16bit sound, which allows more accurate output when the sound volumesetting is less than maximum, and when the square wave generatoris used.</p><p> <a name="option_drives"> <b> Number of disk images </b> </a> </p><p> By default, Mini vMac can mount up to 6 disk images (but for the Mac 128K/512K emulation the default is 2).This is because the replacement disk driver is trying to match the size of a data structure used by thereal disk driver (on the Macintosh 128K/512K this structure is smaller).You can at compile time choose to support more disk images, up to 32, which makes this data structure larger,at some slight decrease in authenticity, and some slight memory and time overhead. Use a line such as: </p><pre>-drives 1-drives 2-drives 3...-drives 6 { (default) }...-drives 16 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0153.html">mnvm0153</a>) } -->...-drives 32</pre><p> According to Apple&rsquo;s Technical Note FL530, some versions of theSystem Software will not work correctly with more than 20 mounted volumes.The Standard File dialogs will corrupt the stack and may crash. </p><p> One reason for using the &ldquo;-drives&rdquo; option is thatthe installer programs for some Macintosh applicationsdon't cope very well with multiple floppy drives,and insist on constantly ejecting theboot or destination disks rather thanthe install disks it has finished with.Some installers with this problem work much betterif all installation disks can be mountedat once before starting. </p><p> <a name="option_ndp"> <b> <i>{Beta} Non Disk Image Protection </i> </b> </a> </p><pre>-ndp 0 <i>{ turn off Non Disk Image Protection }</i></pre><p> <i>As of branch 37, Mini vMac will check if a disk image that is beingmounted looks like a Macintosh disk image format (HFS or MFS), andif not decline to mount it, showing an error message. This helpsprevents accidentally corrupting other files, especially when usingImportFl.</i> </p><p> <i>But there are some other disk image formats that you might want tomount, such as Fat16 and ISO (which can be used by the emulatedMacintosh with additional software). Or, you may be trying to createyour own new disk image and want the emulated Macintosh to initialize it.In these cases you can use a version of Mini vMac compiled with the&ldquo;-ndp 0&rdquo; option to turn off this protection.</i> </p><p> <i>If a <a href="options.html#option_br">Branch</a> option prior to 37is chosen for compatibility with an earlier version,the default is &ldquo;-ndp 0&rdquo;, and you canuse &ldquo;-ndp 1&rdquo; to turn on this protection.</i> </p><p> <a name="option_sony_sum"> <b> Checksum disk images </b> </a> </p><pre>-sony-sum 1</pre><p> With the above line, Mini vMac willupdate the checksum in a Disk Copy 4.2 disk imagewhen it is unmounted. This prevents other programs that deal withsuch images from complaining about an invalid checksum.(I didn't include this by default, because it makes Mini vMacslightly bigger and slower.) </p><p> <a name="option_sony_tag"> <b> Disk images file tags </b> </a> </p><pre>-sony-tag 1</pre><p> With the above line, Mini vMac tries to support file tags,for disk image formats that support them. There are an additional 12 bytesfor each 512 byte block on a 400K or 800K floppy disk, containingsome additional information that was supposed to aid inrecovering damaged disks, but was never actually used much.The Disk Copy 4.2 disk image format can support these tags.(The more usual raw format, such as found in<a href="extras/blanks/index.html">Blanks</a>, does not.) </p><p> For full support of Disk Copy 4.2 format, enable both checksums and tags: </p><pre>-sony-sum 1 -sony-tag 1 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0155.html">mnvm0155</a>) } --></pre><p> <a name="option_sony_dc42"> <b> Disk Copy 4.2 format </b> </a> </p><pre>-sony-dc42 0 <!-- { (<a href="var/mnvm0156.html">mnvm0156</a>) } --></pre><p> The above linecompletely disables support for disk images in disk copy 4.2format. This could be useful when trying to compile thesmallest and simplest version of Mini vMac possible forsome specific purpose. It should not be used when compilinga version of Mini vMac for general distribution, becausea primary goal of Mini vMac is that disk images thatwork with any past version of the program should alsowork with the current and any future version (at leastwhen default compile options are used). </p><p> <a name="option_svd"> <b> Enable Save Dialog </b> </a> </p><pre>-svd 0 { disable save dialog }</pre><p>Normally the OS X and Windows versions will display a save dialogwhen the Mini vMac extension to create a file is used. A savedialog is not implemented in the Linux version, instead itwill create the file in a folder named &ldquo;out&rdquo; inthe application directory. When this option is used to disablethe save dialog, the OS X and Windows version will also saveto an &ldquo;out&rdquo; folder in the same fashion as the Linux version.This is helpful when using Mini vMac in automated scripts.</p><p> <a name="option_iid"> <b> Insert Ith Disk Image </b> </a> </p><pre>-iid 1 { enable Insert Ith Disk Image }</pre><p>When this feature is enabled, if the Control key is held downand a number key from &lsquo;1&rsquo; to &lsquo;9&rsquo; is pressed,then Mini vMac will try to mount a disk image named from "disk1.dsk" to"disk9.dsk" in the folder containing the application.</p><p>This is the same series of disk image names that are automaticallymounted when Mini vMac is launched. But it stops at the firstimage not found. So if you leave a name unused, then you canuse a control-number key to mount disks after launch. Or, youcan use a control-number key to remount a disk that was automaticallymounted at launch and then later ejected.</p><p>One example use is if you have one copy of Mini vMac runninga development environment (such as MPW) that is used to compilea program to a disk image. The disk image is then unmountedand mounted on another copy of Mini vMac running a testingenvironment. If the compiled program crashes badly, thedevelopment environment is not disturbed. The control-number keyfeature makes it easier to move the disk image backand forth between the two copies of Mini vMac.</p><p> <a name="option_ccs"> <b> Command Control Swap </b> </a> </p><p> You can swap the emulated Command and Control keys with: </p><pre>-ccs {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0158.html">mnvm0158</a>) --> Command Control Swap }</pre><p> This could be useful for people who are used to Windows,so that you can use Control-C to copy instead ofCommand-C (or actually Alt-C, as Alt is locatedwhere the Command key is on a Macintosh keyboard). </p><p> It can also be useful for people used to Macintoshwho have remapped the keys on their Windows machineto swap Control and Alt. Using '-ccs' will swapthem back for Mini vMac. </p><p> Linux is the same as Windows in this way, as faras I have seen. </p><p> The '-ccs' option does not affect F1 and F2, butshould affect any other keys that get mapped toControl and Command. </p><p> <a name="option_km"> <b> Keyboard Remap </b> </a> </p><p>Change the mapping between keys on the real Keyboard and keys onthe emulated Keyboard, or the Mini vMac Control Mode. For example:</p><pre>-km Escape CM -km Control Control</pre><p>The first -km above allows using the Escape Key for the Mini vMac Control Mode.The second -km allows using the Control Key to mean Control Keyinstead of the Mini vMac Control mode.</p><p>The general format is &ldquo;-km &lt;src&gt; &lt;dst&gt;&rdquo;,where &lt;src&gt; and &lt;dst&gt; can be one of:</p><pre>ControlCommandOptionShiftCapsLockEscapeBackSlashSlashGraveEnterPageUpPageDownHomeEndHelpForwardDelF1F2F3F4F5</pre><p>In addition &lt;dst&gt; can be &ldquo;CM&rdquo;, which meansthe key for the Mini vMac Control Mode.</p><p>Also in addition, &lt;src&gt; can be one of:</p><pre>RControlRCommandROptionRShift</pre><p>Which means the keys on the right hand side of the keyboard,when both the operating system and the keyboard hardware permitdistinguishing them from the left hand keys.</p><p>It is an error to have no key mapped to the control mode.</p><p> <a name="option_ekt"> <b> Emulated Key Toggle </b> </a> </p><pre>-ekt &lt;dst&gt;</pre><p>Where &lt;dst&gt; can be any of the values allowed forthe <a href="options.html#option_km">-km</a> option, except &ldquo;CM&rdquo;.</p><p>Chooses which emulated key is toggled bythe &lsquo;K&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>.</p><p>When this option is not used, the build system will pick an emulated keythat is not mapped to any real key. That will be the control keyif no &ldquo;-km&rdquo; options are used.</p><p> <a name="option_akm"> <b> Alternate Keyboard Mode </b> </a> </p><pre>-akm {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0152.html">mnvm0152</a>) --> enable Alternate Keyboard Mode }</pre><p> Some commonly used keys, such as the arrow keys, area bit of a stretch to reach, and more importantly,their positions can be different on different keyboards.The Alternate Keyboard Mode provides analternate way to type some of these keys. </p><p> The program starts with the mode on.Pressing the 'm' key leaves the mode. The intentis that you only leave the mode temporarily to type text.(I believe this is a similar idea to how the vitext editor works.)The alternate keyboard mode is entered by pressingthe ';' key. Pressing ';' has no effect when in thealternate keyboard mode, so it can be used at any time tobring the program to a known state. </p><p> In the Alternate Keyboard Mode, the letter keysare remapped as follows (non letter keys areunchanged): </p><blockquote><p>  j - Left arrow<br> l - Right arrow<br> i - Up arrow<br> k - Down arrow</p><p>  s - Shift<br> d - Option<br> f - Command</p><p>  z - F1 (often means Undo)<br> x - F2 (often means Cut)<br> c - F3 (often means Copy)<br> v - F4 (often means Paste)</p><p>  e - BackSpace<br> r - Return<br> t - Tab<br> g - Enter<br> y - Escape</p><p>  a - SemiColon<br> u - [<br> o - ]<br> b - BackSlash<br> h - Equal<br> n - Minus<br> q - Grave</p></blockquote><p> There is a visual indication when the mode is off,intended to be easy to see in peripheral vision, without coveringup where text is normally typed. </p><p> Holding down the command, option, or shift keys willtemporarily turn off the Alternate Keyboard Mode.

You can disable this fix with: </p><pre>-ikb 0 { International Keyboard fix off }</pre><p> One reason for disabling it is because this is fairly large amountof code and US only users don't need it.

For the Macintosh II the defaultspeed is 4x. (A Macintosh II has twice the clock rate, so theactual number of instructions per second executed by defaultis the same. Actually, a real Macintosh II has a 68020 whichexecutes more instructions per clock cycle than a 68000, but Mini vMacdoesn&rsquo;t account for that yet.)</p><p> You can use one of these lines to set initial valueof the Run in Background option: </p><pre>-bg 0 { (default) start with Run in Background off }-bg 1 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0166.html">mnvm0166</a>) --> start with Run in Background on }</pre><p> You can use one of these lines to set initial valueof the AutoSlow option: </p><pre>-as 0 {<!-- (<a href="var/mnvm0169.html">mnvm0169</a>) --> start with AutoSlow disabled }-as 1 { (default) start with AutoSlow enabled }</pre><p>For Macintosh II emulation, AutoSlow is disabled by default.AutoSlow may need some further tuning to work well withMac II emulation.<i>{Beta} AutoSlow is now enabled by default for Macintosh II emulation(unless a prior <a href="options.html#option_br">Branch</a> option is chosen).</i></p><p> <a name="option_ta"> <b> Timing Accuracy </b> </a> </p><p> Mini vMac estimates the number of clock cycles usedby each instruction excuted.

In some future version of Mini vMac,this table should be tested and calibrated by comparing toreal hardware. </p><p> For "-ta 2", Mini vMac supplements the cycles table by computingmore accurate estimates for certain instructionsdepending on the current data. It is still notcompletely accurate. Completely accuratetiming would be exceedingly difficult.For example, the CPU and video outputconflict for accesses to RAM, and that would seem verycomplex to model. </p><p> Currently 68000 timings are used even inthe 68020 emulation. More accurate timing for 68020 should be added in afuture version.

By default, theoperating system will refuse to run applications downloaded from theinternet, unless Apple considers it trustworthy (because it is digitallysigned by a developer registered with Apple). Gatekeeper is in some waysa good idea, but some people consider it as one step along the way tomaking OS X like iOS, where no software can be installed without Apple'spermission, and emulators are forbidden, including Mini vMac.</p><p>When Mini vMac is signed, Apple can at any time choose to revokethe certificate, and Mini vMac will stop working.</p><p>Another issue is that, since Mini vMac doesn&rsquo;t use Apple&rsquo;stime stamp server (because that would break reproducible builds, amongother problems), Mini vMac will probably stop working when thecertificate expires, 5 years after being issued. (The plan is to renewthe certificate every year, so that a compile of Mini vMac should workfor at least 4 years.)</p><p>To avoid these issues, you can disable code signing.The disadvantage is that OS X will by default refuse to run it.One way to override Gatekeeper, giving an application permission to run,is to hold down the control key and click on its icon (or right click)to get a contextual menu, then choose the Open item, and in the warningdialog that comes up click on the Open button.

Thisis for testing the variation service.</p><p> <a name="option_bte"> <b> Test Build System Error </b> </a> </p><pre>-bte { Build System Error }</pre><p>If this option is present, the build system will treat it asan error. This is for testing the variation service.</p><p> <a name="option_xclm"> <b> Override </b> </a> </p><pre>! { Override }</pre><p>Normally it is an error for the same option to be used twice. Ifthis option is present, then options to the right of it willoverride options to the left of it. It is still an error foran option to be used twice on the same side of &lsquo;!&rsquo;.</p><p> <a name="option_br"> <b> Branch </b> </a> </p><pre>-br 36 { Options were from Mini vMac 36 }</pre><p>This option is for future use. It currently has no effect.<i>{Beta} It is now used in Mini vMac 37.</i></p><p>It tells the build system that the requested options were from aspecific branch (version) of Mini vMac.The &lsquo;P&rsquo; command of the Mini vMac<a href="control.html#control_mode">Control Mode</a>gets the options from an existing variation, andincludes this Branch setting. If the defaultsettings have changed from since that older version,then the build system will use defaults of the old version,rather than the current defaults. So the newly generatedvariation behaves as close as possible to the earliervariation.</p><p>The &lsquo;P&rsquo; command retrieves the options in acanonical form. It always generates a &ldquo;-br&rdquo;option for the current version, rather than copyingany &ldquo;-br&rdquo; option passed to the build system.</p><p> : </p><p> If you find Mini vMac useful, please consider<a href="../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</A>.</p><a href="../../index.html"><img src="../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p> Next - <b><a href="develop.html">Options for developers</a></b> </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">minivmac</a>/options- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
