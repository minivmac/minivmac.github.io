Also, almostany emulator(including <a href="../minivmac/index.html">Mini vMac</a>)requires a ROM image file to run, and so can be legallyused only by those who own such a Macintosh.This page has some ideas for where tobuy one. Let<a href="../feedback.html">me</a>know if you know of any other places.</p><p> : </p><p><a href="http://www.ebay.com">eBay</a> usually has some available.</p><p><a href="http://68kmla.org/">68k Macintosh Liberation Army</a>has a "Trading Post" forum.</p><!--<p><a href="http://mc68000.org/forums/">MC68000.org</a>has a "Marketplace" forum.</p>--><p><a href="http://lowendmac.com/lists/swap.html">LEM Swap List</a>is the Low End Mac email list for "buying and selling Macs andMac-related goods." An archive of the list is also available(mentioned near the bottom of the page). Thanks toDan Knight for pointing out this page. It looks quite active,though only a few of the posts deal with 68k Macs(11/21/2005).</p><p><a href="http://www.applefritter.com/forum/107">applefritter Marketplace</a>has two forums, one for the "sale and trade of Apple-relatedcomputer equipment", and the other for "listing ofApple-related computer equipment you are looking to purchase".Only a few of the posts deal with old computers.</p><p><a href="http://kopen.marktplaats.nl/computers-en-software/apple-desktops/c324.html">Marktplaats.nl</a>is described by "Addy" as "the largest second hand site of holland".Searching for old Macintosh model names turns up a few.</p><!--<p><a href="http://www.oldcomputercollection.com/classifieds_1_3/index.php">Old Computer Market</a>is "The place to sell, buy or swap vintage, classic or oldcomputer systems and related items."Only a few of the ads deal with Macintosh computers, but they'reeasy to find since the site is organized so there is a seperatepage for"<a href="http://www.oldcomputercollection.com/classifieds_1_3/index.php?method=showhtmllist&amp;list=classifiedscategory&amp;rollid=25&amp;fromfromlist=classifiedscategory&amp;fromfrommethod=showhtmllist&amp;fromfromid=11&amp;clearoff=1">Vintage Hardware &gt; Apple</a>".Thanks to Stefan for pointing out the new address.</p>--><!--<p><a href="http://www.forevermac.com/collectors.htm">Forevermac.com</a>is "Your Refurbished Apple Macintosh Computer Supplier for theUnited Kingdom". This link is to their "Compact Macs" page.Without obvious dates on their web pages, it's hard totell if they're still in business.</p>--><p><a href="http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites">craigslist</a>has free online classified ads, with a section for computers for sale.There are seperate listings for each city where it is available, whichis nice because shipping can easily cost more than an old Macintosh.But only a very few ads deal with old Macintosh computers.I obtained a Macintosh IIcx through craigslist.
