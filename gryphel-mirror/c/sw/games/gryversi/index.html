Pratt<br>mod date:  Sep 27, 2006<br>license: GPL</p><p> Gryversi is a simple game of Reversi, otherwise knownas Othello(TM), that I wrote a long time ago (formerlycalled ReversiMac, first public release in 1990).The only advantage over&ldquo;<a href="../brev/index.html">Booby Reversi</a>&rdquo; is thatit is easier to beat, and that the source code isincluded, under the GNU General Public License (GPL). </p><p> <img src="../../../../d/sw/games/gryversi/screen.gif" width=514 height=344 border=0 alt="Screenshot"> </p><p> It is intended to become an example of how to programfor the Macintosh Plus. However, the source needs to becleaned up more. Some oddities come from its long history,such as the translation from Pascal to C, and thatthough I've used it as a test case for various developmenttools over the years, I've never spent much time onit at any one time. I've cleaned it up a bit for the 1.0.0release, but more is needed. Anyway, the program seemsto run fine. </p><p> Gryversi should run on any 680x0 or PowerPC Macintosh.OS X for Intel Macintosh doesn't include the Classic environment,but it will run there or on any other computer within Mini vMac.(I've no intention of porting it to the Carbon API, or evenrecompiling for native PowerPC.) </p><p> This version of Gryversi hasn't been tested as extensivelyas Mini vMac. So it is safer to run it within Mini vMac thandirectly on a real Macintosh. </p><p> The included documentation is a Hypercard stack (frombefore the web existed). This can be viewed with the&ldquo;<a href="../../general/hyprplyr/index.html">Hypercard Player</a>&rdquo;,still available from Apple. </p><p> If you find Gryversi useful, please consider<a href="../../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,of which it is a part. </p><a href="../../../../index.html"><img src="../../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p>Here is the md5 checksum for the download, signed with<a href="../../../keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------e9baccabcb96a8f8a7f8cbd43f7b2e1d gryversi-1.0.1c.zip------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/AVZoNq+rd5hLAwTa5JCvzVUEQ3Z06cJ6TXhstp1JRF3GPw/xe/ciEiDXsUVVG/22Hyy5zo0uo9eHjXt6yvd7Rx6kH8JjUEHhSQZlCQ+KT7DBArRo3TIh3jU70qSh7zGvoFtzlKWlG8+CRFCV8kDdaY3gsbTvE6dJPFlU8DKBkDVYDFa-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><p> You can redistribute Gryversi and/or modify it under the termsof version 2 of the GNU General Public License as published bythe Free Software Foundation.

It can also workon a Macintosh 128, but may not always gracefully handlerunning out of memory. The source code is cleaned up a littlebit more, but there is still far to go. </p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../new.html">sw</a>/<a href="../index.html">games</a>/gryversi- <a href="../../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2014 Paul C.
