A unique zoom control makes it easy to choose the magnification you want -- you can zoom in or out anywhere from 1:16 to 16:1, and you can edit all the way. Special effects include different inks that all tools use, graduated gray fills and shadows, the fun 'fisheye' command, and the ability to use the picture on the clipboard to fill an area. To make painting easier, LP has the ability to mask painting to a selected area, as well as a 'snapshot' like that in MacPaint(TM) 2.0. Little touches, like power keys for special effects, and power scrolling to ease moving around the painting, help during editing. </p> <p>LP is $14 shareware (only $7 if you're a student). The best thing I can say about it is that *I* use it all the time. In my biased opinion, it's definitely worth its fee; at the least, it's fun to play with! I'd really like to write more shareware, but that depends on the response I get. Your payment of the shareware fee will show me that someone thinks my programming has value!</p> <p>Hope you enjoy it,</p> <p>Humayun Lari</p></blockquote><p> If you find these downloads useful, please consider<a href="../../../help/index.html">helping the Gryphel Project</a>,which hosts them. </p><a href="../../../../index.html"><img src="../../../../d/gryphel-32.gif" width=32 height=32 border=0	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"></a><p>Here are the md5 checksums for the downloads, signed with<a href="../../../keys/k5.html">Gryphel Key 5</a>:</p><blockquote><pre>--------- GRY SIGNED TEXT ---------a7fcae87c17e274bf7adf47ba1acb6cd lightningpaint.zip5be807dbb90c458e802289f507594550 lightningpaint.sit------- BEGIN GRY SIGNATURE -------Gry/4Xa8CFcUzxdN/Hr0SKNDtPIXdJHiTa9t+un85Xl69t7dOqNVfe8sGk7KZzbCjl8bkqAjA0FrMqRlfQXt6RhP28+Vq3uvVPs2RbwlEin8CTRhL8dmmhPsbdJf94/+V541sDrkqLCZw0wxzbv0EcFVUyHDilPZtdmPB+j8GCxLxOyXFwOgevS3STasov6i-------- END GRY SIGNATURE --------</pre></blockquote><hr><div><i> <a href="../../../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="../../new.html">sw</a>/<a href="../index.html">general</a>/ltnnpnt- <a href="../../../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2012 Paul C.
