I just compiled the latest Mini vMac from source on my x86-64laptop and it works great except for this one thing:</p><p>Every time anything changes on the screen the graphics in that areaget messed up. If I drag the cursor across the screen I get littlecopies of the cursor left behind in the path of the cursor.

This sort of thing on Linux has been reportedbefore. I'm considering having an option to always draw color images,though that would be less efficient.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="140805a"> </a><a href="v1.html#140805a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Aug  5 13:50:08 2014</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Thanks for your wonderful project.

When I tried to Quit Mini vMac, a message appeared saying Ishould Shut Down the emulated computer before quitting Mini vMac. Onlythere is no Shut Down command in the earliest Mac Systems. I see I canforce quit Mini vMac, but "at the risk of corrupting the mounted diskimage file"-which I certainly don't want to do. I sort-of vaguelyremember that on the earliest Macs, one simply turned the hardwareswitch off to shut it down.

A few months ago I came across some workthat James Friend had done to get Hampa Hug's PCE/macplusemulator to run inside a web browser. This absolutely blewmy mind and before long I got myself involved writing anicer web interface in JavaScript that primarily added theability to manage disks (something James' port did not do).To make a long story short, I accomplished that and decidedI wanted to add support for vMac disk images as well. Eventhough I initially started down the path of hacking supportfor vMac images into PCE, it dawned on me that it would befar more proper for me to port vMac to JavaScript, and usevMac to read and write vMac disk images, than it would befor me to bastardize PCE into being something that it isnot.</p><p>So, this brings me to where I am now. I have just done afresh compilation of the SDL 1.2 port of Mini vMac 3.3.3under Linux (-t lx86 -api sdl -no-asm -e bgc) and it doesnot run properly. Without a ROM, I get what looks like aerror console on the screen, but it is severely garbled;with the ROM, I simply get a blank screen and nothing else.</p><p>I just wanted to ask you whether the SDL port is currentlyfunctional and whether you can offer any hints as to why itdoes not work.</p><p>If you are curious as to what my eventual plans are, you cansee a demo here:</p><p><a href="http://marciot.freeshell.org/macplus/">http://marciot.freeshell.org/macplus/</a></p><p>That demo is currently running PCE/macplus. I would like toadd support for vMac and give the end user a choice ofemulation engine. It probably would look more-or-lessexactly the same, except for the minor detail of allowingthe user to use vMac rather than PCE disk images :)</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated!</p><p>Thanks!</p><blockquote><hr><p>The SDL port is believed to be functional, but it is trueI've only tried it on OS X recently. Bug reports arewelcome. I'll try it on Linux when I find time.</p><p>One possible issue is thatif you're running a modern version of Linux on a modern machine,it is likely you are running a 64 bit linux. In that caseyou should be using "-t lx64" instead "-t lx86". Normally,trying to compile the wrong version of assembly code wouldalert you, but you have disabled that.</p><p>Did you try the standard compile without SDL (using X)?</p><p>Update: I have tried "-t lx64 -api sdl -no-asm" on a VMware imageI have of Ubuntu 10.04 with SDL 1.2.14. It seems to workwithout problems. I tried "-t lx32 -api sdl -no-asm" andas expected it didn't work, hanging with a black screen withthe ROM image, and gives a "Segmentation fault" without theROM, which matches pretty well what you describe.</p><p>For the next version, I'll look into having the build system puta check for this situation in the configuration file it generates.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="140225a"> </a><a href="v1.html#140225a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Feb 25 18:46:20 2014</p><p>It Says it cant load Disk Image</p><blockquote><hr><p>Could you be more specific what Mini vMac says?

You could also tryrunning CopyRoms a second time, and make sure it get the same result(by comparing checksums).</p><p>Is the size of the file right (256k = 262144 bytes)?Checking the source, CopyRoms does not seem to check if there isenough free space on the disk, and if there isn't it will just createa file that is too short. But on second thought, if theROM image was too small, Mini vMac should have said so,and not given the corrupted ROM warning, so this is not likelythe problem.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="140116a"> </a><a href="v1.html#140116a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Jan 16 03:37:25 2014</p><p>I downloaded the mac classic version of mini vmac (nmvm0025)and Tried it with my classic rom and it didnt work.I tried copyrom and getrom both with extensions on and off.from the classic it shows as a 256k file and when coppied tomy osx machine it says it is 262 kb. when I load minivmac ittells me the rom image is too short.

When Mini vMac starts, all the SCSIcontrollers for the hard disks will be emulated, but withnothing attached to them, and the floppy disk drive will beemulated, but with no floppy disk in it.</p><p>However, the ROM will still be patched to add Mini vMac's"disk image driver" unless "-drives 0" is set (disablingMini vMac's original style of disk images), although now theSCSI hard disk and floppy disk drivers will no longer beremoved. "-hds 0" can be set in the build system to emulateno SCSI controllers for the hard disks and "-hds 0 -drives0" can also be set, but the floppy drive will always beemulated.</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thank you for your suggestions for a user interface tocontrol SCSI and accurate floppy disk emulation. Butbefore a user interface can be implemented, theemulation must be implemented.</p><p>A good starting point for adding accurate floppy diskemulation to Mini vMac would be to peruse the&ldquo;<a href="http://www.mess.org/">MESS</a>&rdquo;emulator source code for ideas. If anyone wantsto work on this, I'd be quite likely to merge theresult into the source code that I maintain. (Asa compile time option.)</p><p>By the way: In a Macintosh Plus, floppy drives are controlledmostly through the IWM chip, and not the SCSI chip. Other earlyMacs are similar. Also, a Macintosh Plus has only a single SCSIchip, which can be used to connect up to 7 SCSI peripherals.And also, a real Macintosh Plus can only use 400K and 800K floppies.More advanced hardware is needed for 1440K floppies.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="120529a"> </a><a href="v1.html#120529a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Began</b>: Tue, 29 May 2012 04:17:03</p><p>I'm the user in korea but my minivmac doesn't worhask.
