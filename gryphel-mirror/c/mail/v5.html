There is a<a href="http://www.sigsoftware.com/contact/">contact</a> formon that site.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not the right person to ask. Classic Menu is pretty much theopposite of Mini vMac, which tries to look like a simple, standard, wellbehaved application from the point of view of the operating system.I&rsquo;m not an expert on OS X programming, and don&rsquo;t want to be.Most of the complexity of Mini vMac is in platform independent codewhich is of no concern to the operating system.</p><p>Classic Menu seems to be mostly about modifying the behavior of theoperating system. This sort of thing tends to be very brittle as theoperating changes. Updating it to modern MacOS would likely requirea complete rewrite (to start with, moving from the Carbon API to theCocoa API), if it is possible at all. The general trend has been torestrict modifications of the operating system.</p><p>Probably the simplest and cheapest way to continue using it is to run itin a virtual machine. The Classic Menu page says it has problems with OSX 10.7. VMware Fusion, for example, supports running OS X 10.6 server.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m43"> </a><a href="v5.html#m43">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat Aug 12 16:07:47 2017</p><p>Hey paul,i would really like to see you hosting some cgi macintoshsoftware like this one</p><p>[... link to 3D-Edit by Colin Olson on a site withMacintosh abandonware ...]</p><p>i found it in this site.</p><blockquote><hr><p>I see that 3D-Edit says that it is public domain, and socan be hosted on my pages of<a href="../sw/new.html">Software for Macintosh Plus</a>.Thanks for the suggestion.</p><p><i>update</i> -<a href="../sw/other/3dedit/index.html">3D-Edit</a>has been added.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m42"> </a><a href="v5.html#m42">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Aug 10 11:00:11 2017</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>today I've had a crash on a Mac II mini vMac with mini vMac Code 0F19.System 7.1.2, I was working in Hypercard 2.2.

I amable to compile FDisasm without a problem, however.</p><p>Any thoughts?</p><p>Best wishes, and my congratulations for your great work,</p><p>Elliot</p><blockquote><hr><p>This sort of problem would normally be tracked down with a debugger.If that is not convenient,another approach is to insert a single SysBeep call somewhere inthe startup code and see if you hear the beep. By moving theSysBeep call around, you can figure out exactly where the failureaborted the startup.</p><p>FDisasm is believed to be pretty accurate, since it can disassemblea number of ROM images well enough to be reassembled back to theoriginal image. FindCode is not so easy to test. Worse, it hasn'tbeen updated as fixes were added to FDisasm. Probably it wouldbe simplest to throw out most of the instruction decoding in FindCodeand derive it again from the FDisasm code.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m18"> </a><a href="v5.html#m18">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Mon Jun 12 19:46:38 2017</p><p>hi Paul, I'm no more able to get mini vMac working in Mac OS X Sierra(10.12.5) Intel.

By custom builds, do you mean from thevariation service (in which case, what is the variation number), or thatyou have compiled yourself (in which case, with which options, and whatdevelopment enviroment, including version)? In either case, what isthe host operating system and version? Are there any odd characters(anything besides a-z and 0-9) in the path (the names of all enclosingfolders)? Does it make any difference if you move the applicationand ROM image somewhere else (like the root folder of the boot disk)?</p><p> <i>update - <a href="v5.html#m3">follow-up message</a></i> </p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m0"> </a><a href="v5.html#m0">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sun Apr 23 05:53:45 2017</p><p>After trying to compile in Visual c++ 2005, i keep getting this message.</p><p>c:\users\emu\desktop\minivmac-3.4.1-wx86\src\CNFGRAPI.h(16) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'windows.h': No such file or directory</p><blockquote><hr><p>See this<a href="v4.html#m22">similar previous question</a>.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v4.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v5- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
