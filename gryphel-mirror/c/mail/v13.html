Thisprotocol deals with keys being pressed and released, so Mini vMac looksat the keys being pressed and released on the real computer, instead ofthe characters that the real computer would normally translate theminto. So Mini vMac may not be affected if the real computer is set touse the Dvorak layout, for example. But you can make the operatingsystem running within Mini vMac use a Dvorak layout if you want it.

I&rsquo;m pretty sure I must haveknown this at some point, but it is not documented.</p><p>A work around is to enter full screen mode, which activatesa more accurate lower level mouse emulation. This is done onlyin full screen mode, because the emulated hardware only dealswith relative mouse motion. Setting the emulated mouse location toan abolute screen location (as needed when not in full screenmode) requires a hack. This hack is not working for this particularsystem version.</p><p>Oddly, Mini vMac is using a slightly different hack for Macintosh IIemulation. And this newer hack seems to make more sense. I don'tremember, but my suspicion is the original hack didn't work for theMacintosh II, I found a better version, but didn't change it foremulating earlier Macs because of the extensive testing that wouldbe required. Perhaps the newer hack would work for System 4.0.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ll need to do some testing to check this theory.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m325"> </a><a href="v13.html#m325">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Mon, 3 May 2021 19:00:43</p><p>Hello-<br>Thanks for making Mini vMac.

It's a fantastic piece of software, andso versatile! I've been toying with your variation service, which isextra useful for those of us who can't compile our own specific configs.</p><p>I would like to request two additional features on your variationservice. I have no idea how technically possible they are or how muchwork they would involve, so please take them with a grain of salt.</p><p>Please add the ability to specify more RAM than just 4MB for the Mac SEand 8MB for Mac II. I know the SE maxed out at 4MB, and natively the MacII never came from the factory with more than 8MB. But the Mac II andthe SE/30 could both be upgraded to 128MB of RAM with a 32-bit-clean ROM(or some patches). This way, one could pretend to be emulating a maxedout SE/30 - even though it's emulating the 68000 not the 68030 cpu. Butthat's not so big a deal when emulating, since you can speed up or slowdown the emulation to match a faster/slower cpu. Having more RAM wouldopen up a lot of System 7 usability. System 7.5.5 just doesn't run wellin only 4MB of RAM.</p><p>Second, would emulating the 68030 and the Mac SE/30 be possible? I haveno idea what kind of work that would involve, but I'd love to see it ifit's not huge deal. Adding that and the SE/30 to the options of thevariation service would be fantastic!</p><p>Thanks again for all your hard work and for sharing it with Mac fansaround the world.</p><p>Tom</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>The SE/30 is internally much more like a Macintosh II thanthan an SE.

I don'tthink you'd need to have to support an actual serial port. On OS X andlinux, the serial ports are essentially just (somewhat special) files.The person who did the MIDI hack got that to work (and then had to domore complicated work on top of it to expose the MIDI ports to thesystem, I gather). I can actually see the stuff coming out of his MIDIports (but don't know anything about MIDI, but whatever he did workedfrom a serial port point of view).</p><p>From a Mini vMac usefulness point of view, I think the main advantagewould be that for Linux and OS X users, there would be a way to sync afolder between the host system and the emulated Mac. (Admittedly, you'dhave to run an app on the emulated Mac, and a tool on the host system todo the actual syncing; local talk would be a lot faster and easier). Forpeople who also had USB converters, it would be possible to sync betweenan emulated classic Mac and a real classic Mac (which is arguable moreuseful than syncing between your classic Mac and your modern Mac). Isuppose you could also play Falcon head to head with a friend on anAmiga or Mac or Atari ST in the same room as you. That might be a funparty trick at a retro computing convention.</p><p>I'm probably 30-40% done with the sync app. OS X version is up andrunning, and is exchanging information (but not yet files) with the MacPlus over serial.

The idea is that I could have it on a Mac Plus or 512,and share some files between my modern Mac and an old Mac. My stretchgoal is to also build an Amiga client (same protocol, so 1 OS X clientshould be able to talk to Amiga and Mac). I know there are lots ofAppleTalk and Ethernet based solutions for this, and that&rsquo;s fine,but I&rsquo;m dealing with machines that don&rsquo;t have that. Andultimately, I want the syncing to work via WiFi232 modem so it&rsquo;swireless.</p><p>Anyway, long story short: this is a request to add mapping of the serialports on the emulated Mac, to a serial port the user specifies (maybehas to baked in via the build process?). In my case, for example, Iwould map the modem port to /dev/tty.usbserial-FT53JP031, one of theserial ports exposed by my USB converter. That would let me test betweenthe emulated Mac and a real Mac.

I was wondering if it's possible to use drive images with MinivMac? I normally use volume images, which work fine.</p><p>My use case: since getting a SCSI2SD for my Macintosh Classic it wouldbe very useful to be able to write the drive image I use straight to SDcard to be able to duplicate my Mini vMac workspace to my physical Mac.</p><p>I can do this using BasiliskII, but as you know BasiliskII emulates amore recent machine so I can't trust it to replicate the compatibilitiesof my real Mac.</p><p>Finally, maybe I'm missing a trick working with volume/drive images, ifthat's the case I'm ready to be enlightened!</p><p>Apologies if any of my terminology is incorrect. Thanks for your time.Matt</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : work pending</p><p>Mini vMac does not support using SCSI hard drive images. Thinkingabout it, it probably would not be so hard to add support forsuch images which contain only a single volume. If you emailed mesuch an image (preferably mostly empty and compressed), I couldlook into it. (I have documentation for this in&ldquo;Inside Macintosh: Devices&rdquo;, but an example wouldbe helpful.)</p><p>A further difficulty is that Mini vMac can only use disk imagefiles, and not access a device directly. On some operating systems,a device can be treated as a file, which might or might not work wellenough. Another possibility is that the website for SCSI2SD indicatesthat you can specify the starting block and and number of sectorswithin the SD card to treat as the SCSI disk image (and that youcan specify up to four images on the card). So it might be possibleto format the SD card to some file system that your computersupports, then create an image file, where hopefully all blocksare allocated contiguously, then somehow locate the starting blockof the image file on the SD card, and configure SCSI2SD for that.</p><p>Another possibility is to acquire<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/">Floppy Emu</a>,which is known to work with Mini vMac.</p><p>By the way, if you are only setting up an image in Mini vMacinitially, to be used only on your Macintosh Classic, rather thanalternating between using it in Mini vMac and the Classic,it is probably better to set it up somewhere other than theSD card, which is relatively slow, and copy to the SD cardwhen finished. In this case you can just create a volume imagefile that Mini vMac can currently deal with, and when it is done,write that into the appropriate sectors of the SCSI disk image,such as by using the &ldquo;dd&rdquo; command with a&ldquo;seek&rdquo; option.</p><p> <i>update - <a href="v13.html#m312">follow-up message</a></i> </p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m308"> </a><a href="v13.html#m308">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Mar  2 18:47:29 2021</p><p>Its saying unable to locate rom image.</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>Please see the<a href="../minivmac/start.html">Getting Started with Mini vMac</a>instructions.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m307"> </a><a href="v13.html#m307">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Mar  2 17:49:48 2021</p><p>Paul,</p><p>I am a long time professor of Physics at Calif. State U. Fullerton.  Ihave a lot of old Mac Plus/MacII 800K floppy disks full of all kinds offiles, (spreadsheet, document, paint, draw, txt, etc.) and need to getthese over onto the PC world (up thru system 6.05 only, never went toSystem 7, which required all new software programs, etc.)</p><p>I still have my original MacPlus, with operational external floppydrive.  Unfortunately, the 2 hard drives I had no longer areoperational, but I still have them. (they are like 250MB, CMS and Iforget the other one.  I think they failed only because of powersupply).</p><p>I would like to setup my complete Mac System, with all the files, in myRaspberry Pi 4 with either 8GB or 4GB Ram.</p><p>Please help me! How can I get the data from my old floppies to the realword of FAT32 or some such file system?  I do have the older programthat ran on Mac and PC of that era, called Mac to PC, where it couldtransfer and translate most of the files that were on PC or Mac and goback and forth between.  Also had a binary to binary transfer feature. I have the original disks I bought for LOTS of MacPlus software that ranup to system 6.05.</p><p>I would like to get the old MacPlus/MacII era emulation working so thatI could run the old programs, etc. on my Raspberry Pi 4.</p><p>Please, please help me out.  At least so that I can figure out how toget all the old floppies onto a hard drive or some other media (I haveheard people use old Omega drives to connect to Mac.)  I do not know howto get an old SCSI drive that is operational on my MacPlus.  Perhaps youcan direct me to someone.  What is the maximum size HD the MacPlus canaddress?  I don't think that they make drives that small any more. Isthere some kind of SCSI to microSD card conversion available?</p><p>Thank-you for your time</p><p>[... name ...]</p><p>Professor of Physics</p><p>[... email address ...]</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>A while back I made a list of<a href="../convert/index.html">Old Macintosh Disk Conversion Services</a>.I just updated it to remove broken links.</p><p>Checking on Google, it looks like there is a<a href="http://www.codesrc.com/mediawiki/index.php?title=SCSI2SD">SCSI2SD</a>adapter that is for still for sale and maintained.</p><p>There is also<a href="http://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/">Floppy Emu</a>by Steve Chamberlin (who I have corresponded with in the past,and still read his blog).</p><p>The maximum size HD in System 6 is 2GB.

It does seem to be a thingon Linux, particularly for the Raspberry Pi. I gather it ispossible to run X without other components of a desktopenvironment, and the standard Mini vMac for X compiles ought to workin that. But it seems that using a variant of SDL it may be possible tohave an even more minimal system. Perhaps that could be a supportedtarget in a future version of the Variations Service.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v12.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v13- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2021 Paul C.
