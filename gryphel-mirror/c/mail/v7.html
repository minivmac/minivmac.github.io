I hear that the FPU is incomplete and I'd like to finishit. How best to do this? I would rather work with traditional UNIX tools(gcc, emacs, make, diff, patch, etc.). I could generate the Linux GCCsource files and work from there... Thanks, Ellery</p><blockquote><hr><p>How best to complete the FPU emulation is certainly the question.Writing code isn&rsquo;t the issue, knowing what to write is. I havea plan of how to proceed, but it is rather involved.</p><p>But in the meanwhile, if someone created a test case where the currentimplementation gives clearly wrong results, along with a patch to fixit, I&rsquo;d probably merge the patch. (Assuming the patch is crossplatform, not depending on libraries, even the standard c library.)That would be of practical value.</p><p>If you want to do this, yes, use the build system to generatesource code for a particular variation of Mini vMac, and workon that. I can merge in your work to my version if you justsend me the changed files (that is easier for me to deal withthan diff output).</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m73"> </a><a href="v7.html#m73">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed May 30 16:30:31 2018</p><p>Hi Paul, I am not a tech heavyweight but back in the 80's I wrote somebasic code using ZBasic for Mac Plus.

From my<a href="../minivmac/extras/copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>page: &ldquo;The easiestsolution is to use a slightly less old Macintoshthat can use 800k disks, and that has ethernetor other communication options to talk tomore recent machines. Some otherpossibilities are an AppleTalk/Ethernetconverter, an external SCSI drive (though modernMacs can't use external SCSI drives without 3rd partyhardware), a null modem cable, or connectingto the internet with a modem.&rdquo;</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m72"> </a><a href="v7.html#m72">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri May 25 18:12:43 2018</p><p>I'm experimenting with the advanced variations feature, and I am tryingto make a build that suppresses the control menu. I entered the-UseControlKeys 0 into the field, but it came back with a compile error.</p><p>Does it only recognize the explicitly documented options, or did I enterit incorrectly? If the former, what is the benefit of using the advancedvariation menu?</p><blockquote><hr><p>The new&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_km">key mapping option</a>&rdquo;should mostly do what you want. You can say that the Control key shouldbe mapped to the emulated Macintosh Control key, and not theMini vMac control mode. You can also set some other key to mapto the control mode, which would usually be a good idea.</p><p>For the future, I could make it check if no keys are mapped tothe control mode, and in that case define UseControlKeys to 0in a configuration file. Without this check, currently it may leaveunused code in the compiled program.</p><p>Yes, the Advanced Variations Service will only accept the documentedoptions. You can not set arbitrary compile time defines in theconfiguration files. This service passes the options to theMini vMac build program. The intent of the build systemis to take any input, and either generate a valid set of configurationfiles, or generate a useful error message.</p><p>The reason for the Advanced Variations Service is that having aseparate control for every option was getting unwieldy as moreand more options were added.  So the Basic Variations Servicewill eventually be reduced to only the mostly popular options.</p><p>The advantage of using either the Advanced or Basic Variationservice over compiling it yourself is that is faster and easier.First, to compile it your self you have to download thesource code and read instructions and set things up in yourdevelopment environment. (And you had better know how to useyour development environment, because I&rsquo;m not much interestedin teaching you.) Second, even after you have done it a few times,compiling your own version is still likely to be much slower thanusing the Variations Service, unless you spend a lot of timeoptimizing like I have done. Third, a version you have compiledyourself is likely to run much slower than a version producedby the Variations Service, unless you spend a lot of time figuringout how to tweek things for your particular compiler.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m71"> </a><a href="v7.html#m71">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat May 19 05:03:00 2018</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>With the Macintosh II emulation, I'm encountering Abnormal Situation1106 if I press Control-R to reset the emulator.

The&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/develop.html#option_d">-log 1</a>&rdquo;option enables code to support printing to a log file.Nothing actually gets printed without creating code to do so. The&ldquo;-dis 1&rdquo;option enables code for writing out disassembled Mac 68k instructionsthat were executed around the time of the event you are logging.</p><p>This is for programmers working on Mini vMac (mostly me), so onthe developer options page, not on the user options page. Loggingis a primitive technique, but can be quite effective if you knowwhat you are doing. And if you have fast compile/debug cycle. Mini vMacis small, so on a modern machine the cycle is a few seconds.</p><p>If you just want to study the execution of Mac 68K programs, mostof the time you would be better off using a debugger running insidethe emulation, such as Macsbug or TMON, which are much fancier thanany debugging options that could feasibly be added to Mini vMac.(Some of the other times include boot time code, and programs thathave copy protection code that tries to disable debuggers.)</p><p>Also, if you want to study a particular Mac 68K program veryclosely, my<a href="../minivmac/extras/fdisasm/index.html">FDisasm</a>tool, a disassembler, might be useful.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m63"> </a><a href="v7.html#m63">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri Apr 27 04:29:02 2018</p><p>VMac mini have way see Mac memory or debugger mode like MAME/MESS?

I personally don&rsquo;tuse debuggers much, and prefer logging. Mini vMac has variouslogging infrastructure, including a disassembler that can displaycode leading up to an event, by keeping a buffer of recent instructionaddresses.</p><p> <i>update - <a href="v7.html#m64">follow-up message</a></i> </p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m62"> </a><a href="v7.html#m62">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat Apr  5 11:26:42 2014</p><p>Hey, mini vmac is awesome!

I don't have access to afunctioning machine anymore but I wanted to get setup on System 7.5.5but I only wanted to use system disks and other software that I'vedownloaded from apple.com or here on Gryphel since I don't know how muchI should trust the integrity of the stuff on abandonware sites.</p><p>I can extract and boot the System 6 images on the System Software pagehere on Gryphel. After booting System 6 I thought I could then run theSystem 7.0.1 or System 7.5.3 installers also linked from the SystemSoftware page. However, once I get those running they exit with an errorcode saying then can only run on System 7.0.1 or later. Seems like achicken-or-the-egg problem since I need to boot System 7 before I caninstall System 7.</p><p>After some searching I found the Network Access disk hosted from apple(http://download.info.apple.com/Apple_Support_Area/Apple_Software_Updates/English-North_American/Macintosh/Utilities/Network_Access_Disk_7.5.sea.bin). This seems like what I want since it'sSystem 7.5 and hosted from Apple so I assume clean and trust worth. Thedisk supposedly boots any Macintosh but it crashed Mini vMac in Mac Plusmode. It does work in Mac SE thought which is enough to let me get thedata extracted and boot strap my entire system from Scratch using justthe known-source software.</p><p>So my question, do you think the crash is due to an issue with Mini vMacor would it also crash a real Mac Plus? I guess "every Mac" doesn'tapply here since the Mac Plus couldn't read the 1.44 MB disk so itcouldn't boot it anyway under normal circumstances.</p><p>Either way, seems like the Network Access disk is useful for othervariations of Mini vMac and as far as I can tell the only way to makeuse of the System 7 links on the page. I'd suggest also linking to thatdisk image on the System Software page to help other folks like me inthe future.</p><p>Thanks!!</p><blockquote><hr><p>I don&rsquo;t think the Network Access disk would work on a realMacintosh Plus either.

My apologies if its answered elsewhere onthis site but I haven't found it.</p><p>On the compile options page(<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_m">http://www.gryphel.com/c/minivmac/options.html#option_m</a>)it says thatthe Mac II emulation isn't complete and it won't be complete for theremainder of the 3.3.* version. There are also other referencesscattered around graphel.com that Mac II emulation isn't ready or isn'tcomplete yet. Finally, I recall reading a page (can't find it again)that said pretty explicitly that Mac II isn't ready for prime-time sodon't use it for real work.</p><p>So, my question is if all of this is still correct? Is the Mac IIvariant "safe" for real-work in 3.4.* or in 3.5.*? I ask because I useda 3.4.1 Mac II variant last year to do some preservation work creatingarchives of old files and software for real preservation and later use.I'm just wondering if I should be suspect of the quality or veracity ofthose archives now compared to if I had use the standard Mac Plus oranother variant to do the work?</p><p>Thanks!!</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for pointing out that the warning on the options page shouldbe updated. A more recent version is on the<a href="../minivmac/dnld_mii.html">Download Mac II Variations</a>page: &ldquo;Macintosh II emulation in Mini vMac is incomplete, andshould not be relied on to give accurate results, particularly numericresults. (Emulation of the Floating Point Unit is the main incompletepart.) It does seem suitable for games, many of which appear to workperfectly well.&rdquo;</p><p>So the Mac II variation is still not recommended for real work.With that said, if the results seem correct, it is probably ok,as long as floating point arithmetic is not involved.</p><p>Any time you make an archive, with any software or hardware, it is agood idea to verify the archive. Make sure you can extract filesfrom the archive, and that the results match the original.</p><p>Also, it is a good idea make a checksum of an archive (such as MD5)after making it, so you can check later that the archive you haveis actually the archive you have verified, and hasn&rsquo;t gottencorrupted accidentally. So the steps are: make archive, make checksum,and then verify the archive.(One way to make an MD5 checksum is with my<a href="../minivmac/extras/md5im/index.html">Md5Im</a>tool.</p><p>And to be really thorough, you can sign the checksum, to guardagainst malicious corruption.

Launch minivmac-3.5.8.</p><p>2. Drag the System 6.0.8 System Startup disk to minivmac.</p><p>3. Double-click the System Startup drive icon (if minivmac hasn'talready frozen).</p><p>4.

Use CTRL-Q,Y to quit minivmac; the minivmac interface does not appearto be affected.</p><p>More randomly, the emulated computer will sometimes refuse to boot.
