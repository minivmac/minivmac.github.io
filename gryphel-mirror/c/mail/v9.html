(If you are not dealing with plain text,then you have to deal with the issue of files moved to Windows losingMacintosh specific information like resource forks. Most archivefile formats are safe to move between Windows and Mac.)</p><p>If you prefer to access host drives in Basilisk II, it makessense to do that, and use the disk images you create there inMini vMac. Mini vMac has more emphasis on emulating the earliestMacs, while Basilisk II has more emphasis on later Mac 68ksoftware. Each can run some software that the other can&rsquo;t.</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t completely rule out ever adding a host drive accessfeature to Mini vMac, but I don&rsquo;t have much enthusiasm. First,it would require a lot more platform specific code, making Mini vMacharder to port. Second, if I recall correctly, Basilisk II useshooks for external file systems in the Macintosh OS. These hooksdon&rsquo;t exist in the earliest versions of Macintosh OS.Third, host drive access seems the kind of thing that could mostlywork, but frequently run into edge case issues that people wouldcomplain to me about, taking up a lot of my time.</p><p>People that are new to Mini vMac don&rsquo;t necessarilyneed to deal with the import issue much at first, sinceI provide lots of software already imported into disk image formaton my<a href="../sw/new.html">Macintosh Plus software</a> page.</p><p>&ldquo;-hres&rdquo; and &ldquo;-vres&rdquo; are not commandline options, they are options to the Mini vMac build system.The few supported command line options are documented in the<a href="../minivmac/control.html#command_line">Mini vMac User Interface</a>page. But the main emphasis in Mini vMac is compile time options,which allows Mini vMac to be smaller and simpler.</p><p>The<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac 36 Variations Service</a>makes it easy to try out compile time options, compiling customversions of Mini vMac in a few seconds.

The operatingsystem will give Mini vMac time to run when it feels like it. To getuninterrupted output for the emulation of built in sound,there is a buffer that the operating system can get samplesfrom, even if Mini vMac doesn&rsquo;t get time for a while.(This buffering results in lag, which can be a problem such as forgames, so Mini vMac dynamically tries to figure out just how muchbuffering is needed.) But this is probably not the main issueyou are seeing.</p><p>Second, Mini vMac emulates an entire tick, abouta sixtieth of a second (more accurately 60.15), all at once.If the operating system feels like it and runs Mini vMac exactly onschedule, this will run every sixtieth (about 0.0167 seconds). Youremulated Midi clock events are supposed to happen somewhat lessfrequently. So in most ticks one event is emulated, but occasionallythere are no events in a tick. Which is exactly what you are observing.</p><p>The only way to avoid this would be to have the operating systemrun Mini vMac much more frequently, and each time emulate smallpieces of a tick. This would be much less efficient, and itis doubtful whether many operating systems would even allow this.</p><p>If possible, a better option is to buffer output, like theemulation of built in sound does.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m175"> </a><a href="v9.html#m175">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Nov  5 05:00:01 2019</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Hope you are well?

(And anyway, Mini vMac isunder GPL license, so my permission is not needed.)</p><p>Platform specific code is contained in files startingwith &ldquo;OSGLU&rdquo;. To port to another platform,you would create another of these files.</p><p>Alternatively, if someone has ported SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) to your microcontroller, you coulduse one of the Mini vMac SDL ports, OSGLUSDL.c for SDL version 1or OSGLUSD2.c for SDL version 2. (At least as a starting point.The Mini vMac port to Apple&rsquo;s Cocoa was done by portingto SDL for Cocoa, then merging together the source for Mini vMacand SDL, and removing anything not used, and a lot of further cleaningup. Porting this way, I didn&rsquo;t need to know anything aboutCocoa or Objective C before starting.)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m173"> </a><a href="v9.html#m173">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Mon Sep  9 15:27:18 2019</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>This is in response to the issues described by John (Sat May 18 07:41:532019) regarding general lag and lack of mouse responsiveness when infull screen mode, after building Mini vMac in Mojave 10.14.x.</p><p>I experienced the same issues and eventually stumbled on a solution,which at least works for me. After building Mini vMac, I perform a deepcodesign on it, via the terminal. I should add that I don&rsquo;tdistribute these builds to anyone and I retain them for personal useonly. I have no idea why this works, but after code signing each build,they work perfectly with no more lag or issues with the mouse playing upor full screen not working correctly.</p><p>Maybe this could help you track down the issue?

One issue is that Mini vMac currentlydoesn&rsquo;t know when AutoQuit starts. It would be possible toadd an extension to Mini vMac that AutoQuit could call.</p><p>But I would lean towards a different implementation. An optionalextension could be added to Mini vMac to allow Mac software toget and set the speed setting of Mini vMac (which I was alreadyconsidering for a different purpose). Then a version ofAutoQuit could set the speed to 1x when it starts, which couldbe used with a version of Mini vMac that is compiled to startat all out speed. There could also be a version of AutoQuitthat turns the sound back on, which could be used with a versionof Mini vMac that starts with the sound volume off.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m168"> </a><a href="v9.html#m168">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Jul 17 22:13:38 2018</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>I made a modification for the Mini vMac setup tool, so that it candirectly create the cfg/ and bld/ directories, and directly generate thefiles in the cfg/ directory (skipping the step of running a Bashscript).

Everything goesfine when compiling but the mac emulation presents a strange behaviourin the display. Indeed, the screen is black everywhere except a squaresurounding the mouse. And the square follows the mouse movements. Whenpressing the control key, the whole desktop appears but as soon as themouse moves, the display is cropped again around the mouse. It seemsthat everything remains black in the display except what changes on thescreen (such as a mouse movement or displaying the minivmac menu).Building differently by changing the target, screen resolution, fullscreen display and so on didn't change anything.</p><p>I have no such a behaviour on debian (x86 PC) or rapsbian (ARM raspberrypi) using SDL2 option, only on retropie OS. I though that the fault wason retropie side, but the old build from vanfanel(https://github.com/vanfanel/minivmac_sdl2) works just fine. Do you haveany idea of what changed between these two versions or what could be theorigin of this strange behaviour ?

Earlier this month I decided to give 36.04 a go (I've notcompiled since August 2018).</p><p>I'd first like to /thank you/ for simplifying the build process. Anytime I can avoid the sheer frustration that is Xcode (and more so withthe recent versions that break all the old projects) I am pleased. Thatbeing said, I built 36.04 and noticed two issues that do not manifestthemselves on a 10.13 (High Sierra) machine.</p><p>1) Strange lag</p><p>Redraw (menu, window) is quite slow. Almost as of the emulation is finebut the rendering aspect of it is in slow motion. The mouse willsuddenly jump making it difficult to control at times. My builds of3.5.8 from High Sierra do not exhibit this behaviour on Mojave. Yourvariation service build:</p><p>m190518_050828_142.bin: 2018/10/07 with options: -br 36 -t mc64 -m SE-mf 3 -magnify 1 -sss 4 -lt</p><p>Does not exhibit the menu redraw issue, but the mouse can becomecompletely unresponsive when entering full-screen mode.</p><p>2) Fullscreen mode inconsistently breaks mouse input</p><p>In both my own build(s) and your variation service build above, enteringfullscreen mode (regardless of magnification setting) inconsistentlybreaks mouse input. Exiting fullscreen mode restores functionality.</p><p>In attempt to present you with consistent results I spent some timerecompiling and comparing. I build 3.5.8 and 36.04</p><p>on both 10.13 and 10.14 using the same flags (a total of four builds).The result is that I think 10.14's clang has a bug or bugs that triggerthe forementioned issues.</p><p>None of the issues I've reported manifest themselves when 3.5.8 or 36.04is built on 10.13 with clang (clang-1000.11.45.5).</p><p>The only issue I noticed (and one other user reported on your postedfeedback) is that the mouse is laggy on 10.14. I can verify this - it'sas if it buffers mouse input for a few cycles and then attempts to catchup (making it jump). I believe this has something to do with how 10.14handles depreciated OpenGL/CL.</p><p>Using MacPorts I've installed clang-8.0 on 10.14 and built 36.04.Unfortunately this had no effect. So this may be a combination oflibraries and compiler.</p><p>I doubt it matters, but I build with:</p><p>-br 36 -t mc64 -m SE -mf 3 -sss 4 -lt -speed 4</p><p>John</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for the report.

I'm using "-var-fullscreen 0" because when ICommand-Tab out, I don't want Mini vMac to automatically exit fullscreenmode.</p><p>When I'm in Mini vMac, the macOS cursor is hidden, and the emulated MinivMac Mac OS cursor is visible. When I want to switch to another macOSapp, I press Command-Tab. The macOS cursor reappears, and if I releasethe keys immediately, before the macOS app switcher appears onscreen,everything is fine: I am switched to the other macOS app and the macOScursor is visible.</p><p>But if I keep the Command key held down, for example because I want topress Tab (or Shift-Tab) a few times to pick a different app to switchto, then the macOS app switcher appears at which point the macOS cursorchanges to a hand, and after I release all keys, the macOS cursor hides,even though I don't want it to; I'm now switched to the other macOS appbut the cursor is hidden. I then have to find a way to show the cursoragain, for example by moving the cursor over the Dock or by clicking themenu bar.</p><p>I don't have this problem with any other fullscreen apps, not even thosethat -- like Mini vMac -- don't use macOS native fullscreen mode (suchas VLC, the way I've configured it).</p><p>-Ryan</p><blockquote><hr><p>That does sound like a bug. But whose bug could be argued. Thehide cursor API in OS X has always been pretty broken. Mini vMactries to work around it. Really, it is the job of Mini vMac to work aroundoperating system problems, if at all possible. So I should check outthe official Mini vMac build on High Sierra, and see if I see the sameproblem, and if anything further can be done.</p><p>(Probably most other programs don't try to hide the cursor. Mini vMacdoes, because the emulated computer draws its own cursor.)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m153"> </a><a href="v9.html#m153">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Apr 18 15:39:16 2019</p><p>Hi,</p><p>I've been working on an alternative LocalTalk emulation backend  (i.e.an alternative to BPFILTER.H that fulfils the same interface) for MinivMac which is more portable and requires less privilege than theLocalTalk-over-Ethernet backend already there, which seems in currenttesting to give basically plug and play LocalTalk emulation in Mini vMacinstances on a LAN across OS X and Linux.

It might notbe of general interest, since changing the size of the single virtualdisplay usually suffices, but I'm interested in observing what happensin a multi-display setup when windows zoom, when a window straddles twodisplays of different depths, and when displays are rearranged. It couldalso be useful for development to have MacsBug on the second display.

This code wouldneed to be extensively rewritten to remove the assumptionof a single window. It might make things simpler, and good enoughfor testing, to have all the emulated displays at fixed positionsin a single window.</p><p>The emulation of multiple displays in the platform independent codewould probably be straightforward if you just duplicate the fileVIDEMDEV.c for a second display. (There is already VIAEMDEV.cand VIA2EMDV.c, which I keep in sync with some simple scripts.It might be a bit inelegant, but other approaches would tendto add more complexity.) One thing to watch out for is thehack of allowing larger displays than would really fit in theaddress space of a single card, by using the address space ofother slots.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m151"> </a><a href="v9.html#m151">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri Apr 12 14:29:42 2019</p><p>Good morning, Mr. Paul,</p><p>I have some problems with building minivmac for Windows 7, as it turnsout, not even cygwin work when building the latest version of the app. Ieven got the latest version of gcc and make for cygwin to buildminivmac, but the compiling crashes when getting to the end that themakefile for the target is not specified.

I startMini vMac and play sound and it comes out of the 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>Is there a compile option that I need to set to pick the output sourcefor Mini vMac?</p><p>Thanks!</p><blockquote><hr><p>It sounds like Raspbian may not be supporting ALSA sound outputtoo well. Mini vMac does have a run time option,&ldquo;-alsadev &lt;alsadev_name&gt;&rdquo;, for picking the audiodevice used, which might be of some help.</p><p>Mini vMac also has a compile time option, &ldquo;-snd-api ddsp&rdquo;,to use OSS instead of ALSA. But I don&rsquo;t know if this wouldwork any better.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m136"> </a><a href="v8.html#m136">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sun Mar 10 01:21:17 2019</p><p>Hello, I suggest updating COPYING.txt to use the new permanent addressof the FSF (51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301,USA).</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thank you for noticing this.

For exampleresource MDEF 0 begins with the remark "; !! field doesn't fit" followedby assembly that doesn't make sense.

I have only been able to partiallyreproduce this. I get only 7 instances of&ldquo;; !! field doesn't fit&rdquo;.This turns out to happen in the most recent version of FDisasmif a label is in the middle of an instruction.In the Mac II ROM, some of these happenbecause there is a table in the ROM being indexed into aftersubtracting a constant. And currently, it looks, to FDisasm, likethe start of table is shifted by that constant. My preferred solutionis to create a mechanism to tell FDisasm about that constant,which will make the disassembly more clear than in previous versions.</p><p>By there is one case where an operand in the middle of aninstruction is being referred to by other instructions. Ugh.I think I would prefer to put the label at the beginning ofthe instruction and have the referring instruction have a constantas above, so that<a href="../minivmac/extras/reasm/index.html">Reasm</a>won&rsquo;t need to deal with labels inthe middle of an instruction.</p><p>One possible explanation why you are seeing more of these warningsis that you are disassembling a differentversion of the Mac II ROM. The formatting information I provideis for the ROM with the checksum 0x9779D2C4. If your ROM isn&rsquo;tvery similar, it would get out of sync with the formatting informationand there would be a lot more instances of this issue.But I&rsquo;m still not sure how you would get non-ASCII output.</p><p> <i>update - <a href="v9.html#m129">follow-up message</a></i> </p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m126"> </a><a href="v9.html#m126">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat Feb  2 05:02:26 2019</p><p>no ROM image</p><p>Is this project active?</p><p>I see an executable without need for gcc.
