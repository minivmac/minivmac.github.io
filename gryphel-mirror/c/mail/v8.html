Prince of Persia relies on _TickCount for frame timing, which isincremented at every vertical retrace interrupt. Hence the too slowgameplay.</p><p>(Running on Windows x86) I tried changing MyInvTimeStep in OSGLUWIN.Cfrom 1089590 to 987149 (=1000/67*MyInvTimeDiv), and the constant inCyclesScaledPerTick in PROGMAIN.C from 130240UL to 116919UL(=7833600/67). After making these changes, the gameplay speed seems tobe correct, although there are some issues. Most notably, sound becomesgarbled. I can reduce the number of samples per subtick from 370 to 332like so in ASCEMDEV.C:</p><pre>// (22254.54545 / 67) / 16 = 20.75 samples per subtickLOCALVAR const ui3r SubTick_n[kNumSubTicks] = {		21,  21,  21,  20,  21,  21,  21,  20,		21,  21,  21,  20,  21,  21,  21,  20};</pre><p>But, that causes noticable skipping in the sound... I don't know what isthe correct fix for this.</p><p>Would you be willing to address these timing-related issues in MinivMac? It would be great to be able to emulate Prince of Persia, andother games, at the intended speed and without sound hitches!</p><p>Thanks!</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for the report.</p><p>A Macintosh II, unlike previous Macs with built in monitors, canhave one or more external monitors, each of which can have its ownresolution, color depth, and refresh rate.Furthermore, these values may be changed, and the driver software ofeach monitor gives information on what values are allowed.</p><p>For compatibility, the Macintosh II uses its second VIA chip togenerate the same 60.15 Hz interrupt as on previous models,which is used to update the tick count and other tasks.(See the Vertical Retrace Manager chapter of theInside Macintosh: Processes book.)</p><p>My guess is that Prince of Persia is assuming the abilityof monitors to use a specific refresh rate, which Mini vMacdoes not implement. (It pretends to have a single monitor which onlysupports 60.15 Hz. ) Changing Mini vMac to use 67 Hz for theVIA2 timer, as well as the intended monitor vertical refresh interrupt,would not be accurate, and break compatibility with most othersoftware. In the future, perhaps Mini vMac could have an option formonitor refresh rate. This will complicate things somewhat.</p><p> <b>update</b> -Reading more of that thread, it sound like the Macintosh portjust runs slower than some other ports, by intention or accident,and so the emulators are correct. If so, changing the monitorrefresh interrupt frequency will probably have no effect forthis game.

To fix this, make sure the application is notrunning, select the icon of the application (not the alias),choose the Get Info command from the File menu, and edit the&ldquo;Preferred size&rdquo; field of the Memory Requirements.To find the maximum size that will work, choose the&ldquo;About This Macintosh&rdquo; command from the Apple menu,and look at the Largest Unused Block.

It will not noticeif you manually launch and then quit &ldquo;app&rdquo;.)</p><p>Looking at the documentation for the LaunchApplication function,it looks like this behavior can be changed by using launchUseMinimumin launchControlFlags.

(The shell builtin "echo -n" does suppress the newline on Mac OS X10.4 and earlier, which were not POSIX certified.) There is also aseparate /bin/echo executable which unlike the shell builtin echo doeshonor the "-n" flag on all macOS versions.

Note that this option as well as the      effect of `\c' are implementation-defined in IEEE Std 1003.1-2001      (``POSIX.1'') as amended by Cor. 1-2002.  Applications aiming for      maximum portability are strongly encouraged to use printf(1) to      suppress the newline character.Some shells may provide a builtin echo command which is similar oridentical to this utility.

Anotherconcern is what if the disk image was used by a different instanceof Mini vMac and modified.

This is undesirablebecause switching GPUs takes time and the system is unresponsive duringthe switch (it shouldn't take long, but on my Mac with many openprograms and windows it takes over a second which is noticeable), and ofcourse the discrete GPU takes more power which shortens battery life.Mini vMac works fine on the low-power integrated GPU, so it would benice if it wouldn't force the use of the discrete GPU.

I'm not sure ifI'm just getting lucky with my particular Mac model or if Mini vMac'sgraphics needs are so modest that any OpenGL capabilities it asks forare present on all GPUs and so reconfiguration wouldn't change anything.</p><p>The UseAGLfullscreen codepath did not work well for me, but I didn'tfind a way to activate that codepath other than manually #definingUseAGLfullscreen 1, and then I got an error that DisplayIDType wasundeclared, so I had to typedef UInt32 DisplayIDType.

The title bar, frameand shadow are then drawn in Retina mode, and the window contents arestill pixel-doubled as they should be. I didn't notice any problems onmacOS Sierra or High Sierra when dragging the Mini vMac window between aRetina and a non-Retina display.</p><p>Retina mode is possible using the Carbon API too, but it is morecomplicated. In addition to the Info.plist key,kWindowHighResolutionCapableAttribute must be specified when callingCreateNewWindow. This attribute has no effect unlesskWindowCompositingAttribute is also specified, but this attributerequires that Mini vMac implement its Carbon drawing with HIViews, whichas far as I can tell it doesn't currently do, and I'm not sure ifchanging the code to do so would reduce compatibility with oldersystems, or how far back you want Mini vMac to work.</p><p>Is there any reason anymore why a macOS user (or at least a modern macOSuser) should run the Carbon version of Mini vMac? Carbon is of coursewildly deprecated by now, and since it's 32-bit only, it won't be usablein future versions of macOS which will remove 32-bit support. It seemslike it might be ok to just focus on the Cocoa version and not bringRetina support to the Carbon version, or even deprecate or remove theCarbon version entirely. The Cocoa version is working fine for me backto Mac OS X 10.4; I haven't tested earlier versions.</p><p>-Ryan</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for the report and patch. I think I should be able to get accessto a computer with Retina screen to try this on.</p><p>This doesn&rsquo;t seem to be documented very well by Apple.I finally found reference to it at<a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/GraphicsAnimation/Conceptual/HighResolutionOSX/Explained/Explained.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012302-CH4-SW1">High Resolution Guidelines for OS X</a>which is an old document that is in a section of the website thatApple excludes search engines from. I noticethat modern applications from Apple included with the OS don&rsquo;tuse NSHighResolutionCapable, so I wonder what the currentrecommended technique is?</p><p>The Cocoa port was new to Mini vMac 3.5.8, so I didn&rsquo;t encourageevery Mac user to use it then. Now that it&rsquo;s been out for a whilewithout problems, I&rsquo;ll probably encourage all Mac users whoaren&rsquo;t using historical computers to use the 64 bit Cocoa port, atleast for Mini vMac 36. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll bother to support32 bit Cocoa. It has been over a decade since a Mac hasbeen made that can&rsquo;t use 64 bit applications. I would probablykeep the Carbon version available, but not bother supporting Retina,which wouldn&rsquo;t be supported by those historical computers.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m85"> </a><a href="v8.html#m85">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed Jun 27 11:51:52 2018</p><p>Paul,</p><p>When I specify "-t imch -all-src 1" in the build system for36.00alpha180610, I get the error message that the disk is full.

I'm seeing aproblem that may be a bug in Mini vMac when not emulating a MacintoshPlus. A system error occurs when booting System 7.0.1 (with System 7Tuner) or System 7.5.5, when AppleTalk is on and CPU speed is greaterthan 8 MHz.</p><p>AppleTalk is off when Mini vMac is first launched. I boot System 7, openthe Chooser and click the Activate radio button, which requires arestart to actually activate. I restart and reinsert the startup disk,and a system error (divide by zero) is encountered. The Restart buttonin the system error dialog box usually does not work.</p><p>The system error dialog suggests that extensions may be disabled bypressing the shift key at startup. Doing so does not prevent the systemerror.</p><p>I've tested Mini vMac version 3.5.8 and 36.00alpha180610, both compiledby me using MacPorts *without* the "-lt" build system option, running onmacOS Sierra or High Sierra. I see the problem when emulating aMacintosh Classic, II, SE or SE FDHD. I don't see the problem whenemulating a Macintosh Plus.</p><p>For all but the Macintosh II emulation, if I first change the CPU speedto 1x, the system boots normally. For the Macintosh II emulation, 1xspeed is 16 MHz and the system error still occurs. If I patch the MinivMac source code to change kMyClockMult from 2 to 1 for the Macintosh IIemulation, then it boots successfully at 1x speed. Increasing the CPUspeed again after startup is complete doesn't seem to cause anyproblems.</p><p>Earlier System versions don't require a restart to activate AppleTalkand don't exhibit this problem. I didn't test System 7.1.</p><p>-Ryan</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for the report. Unfortunately, since the AppleTalkemulation stuff is complex, and not much software uses it, thisis a low priority for the Gryphel Project.It was years ago that I tried to get it to work well in Mini vMac, andwasn&rsquo;t really satisfied. And since then I&rsquo;vemostly forgotten the details.</p><p><b>update</b> - now I notice you said without the &ldquo;-lt&rsquo;option. That might be a bit higher priority.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m82"> </a><a href="v8.html#m82">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed Jun 27 03:40:27 2018</p><p>Very nice project.

Is there a Dev mailing list to make communication easier?</p><p>2. Do you envision 100% emulation of the FPU? Because SANE and 68881could yield slightly different results in some cases. Also see below:</p><p>"* Improved FPU emulation, originally written for Mini vMac by RossMartin. This code was modified to use SoftFloat, by John Hauser (asfound used in the Bochs emulator), plus some extensions to SoftFloat byStanislav Shwartsman (also found in Bochs). Though using SoftFloat isslower than using native floating point, it ensures consistent resultson different computers, and makes it easier to compile with differentdevelopment environments. There's still a lot of work to do on the FPUemulation, but it already allows much more software for the Mac II torun without crashing."</p><blockquote><hr><p>(1) No.</p><p>(2) Actually, I&rsquo;ve been thinking of having the FPU emulationreturn the same answers as SANE does, since the algorithmscan be studied in detail, rather than what an actual FPU wouldreturn, as there is no clear way of matching its results.Compatibility should be pretty good, and I remember readingdocumentation from Apple that SANE is a bit more accurate.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m80"> </a><a href="v8.html#m80">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed Jun 27 02:00:24 2018</p><p>1.
