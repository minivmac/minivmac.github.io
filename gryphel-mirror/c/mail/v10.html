Michael Juneau ("Mu0n"at the 68kMLA) told me he contacted you about this very problem way backin 2004.  Our active discussion on the matter is at the following URL,with a quote from the email that was exchanged with you in 2004:</p><p>https://68kmla.org/forums/index.php?/topic/59618-epyx-winter-games/&amp;do=findComment&amp;comment=636944</p><p>Would you be able to comment on your findings since then?</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>James Wages (JDW)</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : work pending</p><p>I see it is said that Winter Games can work in MESS (now mergedwith MAME). Which changes things. For software that never workedin emulation, there is no clear path to figure out the problem.One could look at it for weeks with no guarantee of solving it.If software used to work in Mini vMac, and now doesn&rsquo;t(called a regression), it is pretty straightforward to figure outwhich change broke it, and figure out why. If software works ina different emulator, that is open source (such as MAME), then I canthink of a way to proceed that would be guaranteed to find the answer.Unfortunately, that method could take weeks or months.</p><p>Thinking further, I can think of an approach for helping to trackdown difference in the CPU emulation between emulators. That couldbe worth trying.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m228"> </a><a href="v10.html#m228">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue May  5 15:58:56 2020</p><p>Hi again!</p><p>I've been remaking my 3DS port, and I'm interested in integrating itinto the new build system.</p><p>How easy/hard is it do implement?</p><p>Currently I have to target SDL and manually edit the files with eachoptions change.</p><p>So far the port itself performs well with sound on the New3DS model.</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>The build system is a bit messy, since it is dealing with themessiness of numerous development tools.

In the Macintosh IIsi,the FPU is optional. But Mini vMac does not emulate the IIsi yet. Andit doesn&rsquo;t look so simple - according to Apple&rsquo;s developernote it is using the built in MMU of the 68030 CPU to remap memory.Emulating an MMU seems like even more of a headache than emulating anFPU.

I gave the custom build utility a try,and, while a little bit daunting to figure out what is what and inaiming to recreate the default binary's setup for the most part, it'squite useful/good.</p><p>My suggestion is to start with the default setup as a template, andallow the user to custom edit only those 'advanced' features thatconcern them, in an expanding fashion. This will make the user interfaceof the builder a lot less daunting and a lot more user-friendly.</p><p>Your documentation on the site is noothing short of excellent! The bestI've seen in recent years -- really well written! Concise, yet providesalmost all key information efficiently.</p><p>I do have one problem with Mini vMac out of the box, so to speak:</p><p>While running HyperCard on System 7.1, I've encountered a number ofcomplete system freezes while the software was playing back audio *and*changing/transitioning an image at the same time.</p><p>At first I thought the ROM may be responsible, but after trying a fewdifferent dumps, it seems to me that this is actually some sort ofbug/problem with the emulation. Have you received any reports of thisyet?</p><p>One thing I am thinking of trying tomorrow is to build a custom binarywith the sound completely disabled, and see if the freeze still occurs.(Going by process of elimination to find the cause.)</p><p>Two instances where these freezes are more or less consistent is thechanging of the ballerina poses in the HyperCard Tour feature, and theopening and closing of drawers repeatedly in "the Manhole".</p><p>Both events cause the system to completely freeze, even though MinivMac is still responding with its hover menu.</p><p>I am forced to forcibly quit the emulator, as the system is renderedcompletely useless/stuck, with no end in sight and no means to getcontrol back.</p><p>Let me know if you need more details. I hope there's a solution forthis problem. Looking forward to hearing from you.</p><p>Kind Regards,<br>Bryan</p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Fri, 24 Apr 2020 22:00:56</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>A follow-up on this:</p><p>After running a few tests, it seems this is not sound or graphics, butemulation related. On lower emulation speeds the freeze occurs lessoften.</p><p>More interestingly, the emulation speed will suddenly change for abrief moment, and run at full speed (making the visual transitioninstant), regardless of my speed setting in the emulator. I believe thisis what's messing with the software and causing it to freeze. I'm notsure if this is a bug of a feature of the emulation. Is it playingcatchup?</p><p>I am running Mini vMac version 36.04 on a 64-bit Linux Debian 9(Stretch) machine, with the following setup:</p><p>-br 36 -t lx64 -fullscreen 1 -magnify 1 -drives 16 -bg 1 -as 0 -svl 5</p><p>Here's how to reproduce the problem:</p><p>1. Run HyperCard, click on the HyperCard Tour icon.<br>2. Click through the introduction.<br>3. Select "Looking at HyperCard".<br>4. Keep clicking the "Next" button until you reach the ballerina(after the parrot).<br>5. Click the ballerina position labels to play the image transition andsound. Do this a few times going through the positions. Chances areinstant transitions will begin occurring and the software (in fact thewhole System) will freeze after that.</p><p>This sudden snap-transition should not be happening. The software isnot programmed to allow for it -- so it's an unexpected emulationinconsistency.</p><p>If you get this email, let me know if you're interested inseeing/testing it in action, and I'll send you a zipped live packagewith my virtual hard disk and setup (with System 7.1 and HyperCardinstalled).</p><p>Let me know if you have any settings tips/tweaks regarding emulationspeed and accuracy that may help solve this mystery/problem.</p><p>Thanks.</p><p>Kind Regards,<br>Bryan</p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Fri, 24 Apr 2020 22:52:08</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Found a workaround!</p><p>I had to make a build with "-ta 0" added, and run the emulation at 1xspeed.</p><p>The cycle estimation ("Timing Accuracy") is what's messing with thesoftware and causing the whole system (including the mouse cursor) tofreeze.</p><p>Forcing the emulator to not skip anything ("least accurate timing", buthighest emulation accuracy) and to run everything at real-time speed(1x) eliminates the issue.</p><p>I see from the documentation that the "Timing Accuracy" (cycleestimation) is still something you're working on and perfecting, right?</p><p>It's nice to have the old system running swift at 8x speed, but thisshouldn't come at the expense of emulation/software errors.</p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Bryan</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : fixed in alpha version</p><p>Thanks for the bug report. I can reproduce this issue with the HyperCardTour stack and the Manhole, when running at faster than 1x speed.I&rsquo;m not seeing it when running at 1x speed, regardless of timingaccuracy. Are you sure you are seeing it in that case?</p><p>If it is only not working at faster than 1x, that is not exactly a bug,just an incompatibility. It is to be expected that some software wouldnot work with what is inherently inauthentic. Perhaps some changes toexactly how the how the extra cycles are added might allow some programsto work better, but then may break other programs.</p><p>There have been only a few known incompatibilities with 8x speedin nearly 2 decades, and defaulting to 1x speed would make Mini vMacmuch less usable. So I think the 8x default should stay. For peoplewho feel otherwise, it is a compile time option(&ldquo;-speed z&rdquo;).</p><p>But I should document somewhere known incompatibilities</p><p>Regarding the Variations Service, if you say that it is not clearto you, then you are right by definition, and I should make tryto make it clearer. But I&rsquo;m not sure how.</p><p>The form does say &ldquo;The above choice is the only one required.Change at least one of the options below to customize yourvariation.&rdquo; So nothing needs to be done to&ldquo;recreate the default binary's setup&rdquo;. Just don&rsquo;tchange anything. I guess I should say that explicitlyin the directions.</p><p>Regarding the many options, the intent is that people shouldtry the Basic service first, which has only a few options. Afterseeing how that works, they should have more confidence in usingthe Advanced variations service.</p><p>As for grouping similar options together, which then could havea control to expand/collapse, that can&rsquo;t be done with basicHTML. A design constraint of the website is that it should beusable with the earliest web browsers that can run on a MacintoshPlus. (Admittedly this constraint is mostly an excuse for me to not haveto keep up with web fashions.) Anyway, I&rsquo;m not convinced that sucha control would actually make this page easier to use.</p><p><b>update</b> 4/25/2020 - I&rsquo;ve tried to make the<a href="../minivmac/var_dir.html">Variations Service Directions</a>clearer.</p><p><b>update</b> 4/26/2020 - After reviewing the source code andfiddling with it, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind. Better behavioris possible.</p><p>In the latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a>source snapshot,the emulation of VIA timer 2, used for playing sound, has beenmodified when running at greater than 1x speed. There is no correctbehavior in this case, it is just a matter of picking what hasthe best compatibility with the greatest number of programs. Thischange fixes the reportedissue with HyperCard, as well as playing alert sounds in theSound control panel, and the "Try Scale With Sound" command ofResEdit. However it also no longer passes theClock/Interrupt Test of MacCheck. Which seems a good trade off,unless further issues are found. (A program to test hardware*should* notice that something is strange when run at greaterthan 1x speed.) The specific change made is thattimer 2 now continues to run during extra cycles only for theduration of a short timer interval, rather than continuing to runin this case until the end of the extra cycles. (Normally, thetimer is paused for the extra cycles.)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m223"> </a><a href="v10.html#m223">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sun Apr 19 20:52:53 2020</p><p>Hello,</p><p>Thank you for minivMac which is an excellent piece of software!</p><p>However there is one bug that bothers me: the emulation of 68020+ bitfield instructions' handling of Z and N flags is broken in minivmac36.04</p><p>This causes an issue in the Macintosh versions of the game 'DungeonMaster 2' where doors won't open.

But then I realized that BFINS isdifferent from the other bit field instructions, and Mini vMac isnot following the documentation for BFINS. Looking at a version ofWinUAE source I had (from 2017), it indeed handles condition codes forBFINS differently. So the initial patch in the message was later fixed.</p><p>So I will make the change for BFINS, and hopefully that willfix the problem with &ldquo;Dungeon Master 2&rdquo;.</p><p><b>update</b> 4/23/2020 - fixed</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m222"> </a><a href="v10.html#m222">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed Apr 15 15:57:13 2020</p><p>Please add a 32MB/64MB option to the Macintosh II version of minivmac.A lot of people need more ram when they are doing 2k or 1080presolutions.</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>For the most part, the amount of main memory used in a Macintosh IIis not affected by the resolution.

It would be possiblefor Mini vMac to provide a different icon, as a compile time option.I&rsquo;m not sure there really is a single default hard drive icon.I don&rsquo;t see any such resource in the System or Finder files.I suspect that various driver software just provided their own icon.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m218"> </a><a href="v10.html#m218">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Jul 17 22:13:38 2018</p><p>Thanks Paul for vMac.

But Mini vMac's own disassembly shows the wrongregister:</p><pre>4080E87A  BTST #5, 16(A4)</pre><p>Another example: the ROM disassembly is:</p><pre>6C00   0929 0004                 BTst.B    D4, $4(A1)</pre><p>But what Mini vMac claims it ran is:</p><pre>40806C00  BTST D4, 4(A4)</pre><p>Again, wrong address register. As far as I can tell, this fixes it:</p><p>https://github.com/ryandesign/minivmac/compare/master...disasm</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>-Ryan</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks for the bug report and fix. I should figure out howto merge the code for this disassembler in Mini vMac with the codeof FDisasm, which by now is fairly well tested, and testable.The disassembler in Mini vMac is not so easily testable.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m179"> </a><a href="v10.html#m179">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sun Nov 24 13:41:36 2019</p><p>how,s the mac II doing, i,m looking up to a complete mini vMac II, or atleast one with the floating point</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : received</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v9.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v10- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
