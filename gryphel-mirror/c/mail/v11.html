I have merged in yourpatch.</p><p>I then reorganized the X11 keyboard initialization code tomake more efficient use of the GetKeyboardMapping call thatyour patch uses to replace XKeysymToKeycode.(Not that it was seriously inefficient before.)Hopefully I didn&rsquo;t create new bugs.</p><p>The latest Mini vMac<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a>source snapshot has this new code.</p><p>The sequence of edits was: replace the long list of calls toKC2MKCAssignOne with a table (composed of const arrays) and a loop,which should make the compiled code significantly more compact.Since there is then only a single call to KC2MKCAssignOne, itscode could be moved into the loop. Then the two nested loops wereinverted, first looping over X11 key code and inside looping overMac key codes to find the matching KeySym - which makes possible asimple optimization. Instead of just searching through the tablefrom the beginning each time, it starts from the next element afterthe previous match. If the table is sorted to match the X11 key codetable, almost no searching is needed. So the table was next ordered tomatch the Linux key codes, the most common X11 port. A furtheroptimization is noting that many of KeySyms not found in the tableare very large, so we can first find the largest KeySym in our table,and avoid searching the entire table for KeySyms that are larger.(Adding a more generally efficient lookup such as binary searchor hashing would require a bit more code, and be slower than thecurrent code for Linux.)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m265"> </a><a href="v11.html#m265">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Aug 27 22:07:52 2020</p><p>How do I download .ROM for mini mac</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>The FAQ page has a section about<a href="../minivmac/faq.html#rom">ROM images</a>.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m264"> </a><a href="v11.html#m264">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Aug 27 05:23:02 2020</p><p>Thanks.

The emu Mac boots okaywith Plus ROM and 6.0.6, 6.0.8 sys.  I know the legal quandary ofvirtual/hardware ownership, in my case added by distance (my oldmachines are in a distant basement and I'm here, wondering if someone isplaying all my records...)       I was a Mac user long ago and advocatefor practical elegance and user control of features, and developmentgoes forward (i.e. paying in at a 1000$ for the 80s computer, you havefunded a lot of good designers and programmers).  I was a Pascal andBASIC writer in the days of color machines, learned on Apple IIs.</p><p>In any case - this leads to, I support 'abandonware', 'freeware', and'shareware' as idea, commerce in measure and it all gets verycomplicated.  Internet searches seem to ignore a lot of terms and manyalgorithm or novice jumbled web pages are frustrated because I usedBoolean, "" and () - * effectively back when, (exact phrases, optionalwords, and partially complete).  So I'm getting a strangely skewedindexing system and a lot of fake news... please let me know if you arehaving these sort of problems too- not to complain so much but:</p><p>MOST of the Mac (68000 series) SW I find is in .sit formats andwindows10 makes it difficult to acquire software and deal with these byall kinds of repressive installation procedures - the Microsoft systemis essentially a virus, but this is the machine I have.  No LineX hasproved to take it's place, would engineer my own..etc...</p><p>For AUTHENTICITY I Mostly was seeking 800k and 1.4Mb WHOLE disk imagefiles .img .dsk to ensure I'm getting real software in a complete form,and historically authentic or if not, at least the product of someonewith a knowledge of this.  I am (Reluctantly) going to try the ImportF1program and disk images now.  If there is a site or sites with morecomplete and historically verbatim .dsk let me know.</p><p>As I said - internet search problematic, and same with forums - it seemssomewhat like sabotage - I hope your technical dialog is easier withpeople because I am an island of thinking here, in the developed worldnonetheless.</p><p>Also, years back I ran vMac on a new Mac (hilarious but necessary, andexcitingly worked.)

For thefloppy disk driver replacement, it directly modifies the ROM image,overwriting the real driver. For other things, Mini vMac emulates moreof the hardware than Basilisk II. So the software for shutdown does notneed to be modified. For the Mac SE, IIRC, the shutdown trap mostly onlyejects disks and then puts up an alert to tell the user to turn off thepower switch. For a Macintosh II, the hardware can turn off its ownpower, and Mini vMac emulates that functionality, to make Mini vMac quiton shutdown.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m253"> </a><a href="v11.html#m253">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri Jul 10 17:49:21 2020</p><p>Hello, thank you very much for that Emulator !

However,I'd like to type in the high ascii characters in sequence and I can'tfigure out how to do that. If I import a txt file with those charactersand open it in MacWrite 1.0, I can see all the special characters (atleast those that aren't boxes). But if I script my host OS to sendkeystrokes of ascii 33-255, it mostly just repeats the "a" character(past 128 or so) into it. Not always, I guess your emulation logicrecognizes some but not others.</p><p>I'm attempting to screenshot the characters (one at a time) in the hopesof turning them into TTF fonts. While others have done it, they've onlydone so for the regular (not styled) fonts, which misses the algorithmMacWrite uses to make them bold/italic/etc. I was hoping I could createversions that also have the styles. While it would be easy to screenshotall 220 characters at once after loading the text file, I can't figureout a way to crop the letters out individually. If I could "type" them,it would greatly simplify things.</p><p>Honestly, I'm not sure how anyone ever typed the characters from highascii into a Mac Plus with an original keyboard.</p><p>If you could help, it would b greatly appreciated.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>John O.</p><p>john.m.oyler@gmail.com</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : responded</p><p>You can type most Macintosh special characters by holding down theoption key.

If youdownload &ldquo;minivmac-36.04-lx64.bin.tgz&rdquo; from the<a href="../minivmac/dnld_std.html">36.04 (Stable) Standard Variations</a>page, and then create a sponsored variation from<a href="../var/index.html">Mini vMac 36 Variations Service (Basic)</a>,choosing only &ldquo;Linux - x86-64&rdquo; and no other options, youwill get identical binaries, with an md5 checksum of499827d3defee725c1decddc4497e637.</p><p>I have made the intended modification to the<a href="../minivmac/a_var.html">Alpha Variations Service</a>.Using JavaScript is very definitely not my intention.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m237"> </a><a href="v11.html#m237">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Sat, 23 May 2020 13:58:52</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>Regarding the variations service, what made it more difficult to adoptprimarily was the inconsistency in behaviour between the latest standardbuild I first tried, and the latest variations build by default.</p><p>As a user, what I expected is that the variations service will buildthe standard configuration without my customising/modifying anything.But instead I got a build where Mini vMac did not go full-screen anddouble-sized as in the standard build. I had to hunt down and figureout why my variations build wasn't behaving as the default buildout-of-the-box.</p><p>So this inconsistency is what really threw me off and caused someconfusion and difficulty grasping how the variations service works.That, and the fact that there are a lot of customising options in theadvanced variations service, and too few in the default one. Thankfullyyour good documentation and resource links on the option titles helpedme relatively quickly figure it out.</p><p>To make it more user-friendly, the variations service should follow thestandard build configuration, with extra options to change thingsto the user's needs/liking, starting with the most common/obviouschanges, and going into finer details down the line.</p><p>This way it feels less like building, and more like customising -- andrequires less (potentially unnecessary) effort to learn.</p><p>Hope this user insight helps.</p><p>Kind Regards,Bryan</p><blockquote><hr><p>[<a href="v10.html#m224">previous message</a>]</p><p><b>status</b> : change made in Alpha</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. It is helpful.</p><p>The variation service should in fact &ldquo;buildthe standard configuration without my customising/modifying anything&rdquo;. Anything else would be a bug.</p><p>Do you mean that it would not go full-screen by default, or thatthe toggle command (Control-F) was not there? The default variationvery deliberately does not start full screen, to avoid gettingbeginning users into a situation they can&rsquo;t easily get outof. In your previous message you mentioned using&ldquo;-br 36 -t lx64 -fullscreen 1 -magnify 1 -drives 16 -bg 1 -as 0 -svl 5&rdquo;.So my guess is that you forgot this is not the standard variation.</p><p>To avoid this sort of situation, I&rsquo;m thinking I could change theBasic Variations Service to allow and strongly encourage entering theoptions from an existing configuration (using Control-P), as in thecurrent Text Based Variations Service. And then, by adding a text fieldat the bottom for additional options, a separate Text Based page becomesunnecessary.</p><p><b>update</b> 5/23/2020 -I have made this modification to the<a href="../minivmac/a_var.html">Alpha Variations Service</a>.Except on second thought, I think the Text Based page for specifyingadditional options should remain separate.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m236"> </a><a href="v11.html#m236">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Sat, 23 May 2020 13:42:09</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p>How do I get the updated build?

Mini vMac actually had such a port, "gen", fromversion 2.8.0 until version 3.2.0. After that the classic Macintoshport, "mac", was designated as the "reference" implementation,containing all comments about what platform dependent code issupposed to do, not repeated for each platform. That port was chosento be neutral to the modern supported platforms. But at thecurrent time, make the SDL port the "reference" implementation wouldbe more practical. Because the easiest way to port Mini vMac to a newplatform is to port it to SDL on that platform. Then if a more nativeport is desired, the source code for SDL can be merged with Mini vMac,all SDL code not used for that platform can be removed, and then alot of cleaning up. I did the Cocoa port this way, without everhaving used Cocoa or Objective C before.</p><p>One issue with this idea is that there are two SDL ports, forSDL 2.0 and SDL 1.2, and they are both still useful. I could mergethe ports, even though there are significant differences (by testingwhether SDL_MAJOR_VERSION is 1 or 2). And then put all comments aboutporting into it.</p><p>I could go further and say that if SDL_MAJOR_VERSION is defined to0, then the SDL API is not used at all, and that would be the skeletonport again, useful when SDL does not exist for a platform.</p><p>Clearly, I should create a page that documents porting. People areotherwise may not have noticed that "mac" was supposed to be thereference platform.</p><p>For a style guide, I could start by a least documenting what rulesare being enforced automatically by scripts of mine. I don&rsquo;trequire that code follow these rules before I would merge it intomy version of Mini vMac. But I will rewrite the code to make it followthese rules. I don&rsquo;t mind this rewriting, it helps me learnhow the code works. I won&rsquo;t merge code without feeling Iunderstand it pretty well.</p><p><b>update</b> 5/21/2020 -The source code for the SDL 1.2 and SDL 2.0 ports are now merged intoone file, and it has been made the reference implementation, withcomments that apply to all ports. The SDL port has been further modifiedso that if it is compiled without including the SDL headers, it will notuse SDL, only standard C libraries, making a skeleton port.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m233"> </a><a href="v11.html#m233">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue May 12 17:23:07 2020</p><p>Hi.</p><p>The new repo for the 3DS port is at:https://github.com/TaraHoleInIt/minivmac-3ds</p><p>It also contains my hacky changes to the setup tool, but I still need tofigure out how to generate a Makefile that devkitPro likes.</p><p>For the time being I've been doing the Makefiles manually.</p><p>Thank you again for Mini vMac.

I will test thenew build (and interface) and answer your letters soon. Thank you forlooking into this, and (from what I understand) this solution soundsright. One of the main reasons people would be emulating the old Systemthese days is precisely because of HyperCard. If this solution doesn'twork out in the wider sense, it would be worthwhile consideringcreating a build specifically for HyperCard.</p><p>HyperCard may have been abandoned -- due to a now obsolete personalfeud between Steve Jobs and Bill Atkinson -- but it is still the bestmultimedia/hypermedia concept testing software, still relevant to-date!And in many ways it still outshines what the Internet can do these daysin terms of creative possibilities.

It could easily emulate more memory,but the software would not work.</p><p>If Mini vMac had a working PMMU implementation, you could justuse MODE32. It is possible that MODE32 might be gotten to workwith a partial PMMU emulation, that it might only require supportingswitching between a few simple memory mappings. While gettingvirtual memory to work would make much more extensive use of the PMMU.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v10.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v11- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2019 Paul C.
