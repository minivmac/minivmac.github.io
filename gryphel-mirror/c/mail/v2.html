Ihave the mini vmac emulator and mindwrite 2.1 up and running, but myexperience so far is that I cannot import the old mindwrite files to themini vmac ecosystem, though I gather from the testimonials page thatthis must be possible.  How do I do this? And then how would I exportthem again in another format, readable by contemporary word processingprograms?  Please note that I cannot currently open any of the mindwritefiles using any contemporary WP programs, which is why I am attemptingto use min vmac. Thanks in advance for your help.</p><p>Dan Lawrence</p><blockquote><hr><p>I happen to own MindWrite 2.1, though I haven't looked at it muchbefore (bought cheap secondhand, among many others).</p><p>As far as I can tell, though MindWrite does write a littlebit of information to the resource fork of a file, it doesn'treally require that information. So you can use<a href="../minivmac/extras/importfl/index.html">ImportFl</a>to import MindWrite files. Then you just have to setthe file type to "OUTL" so that MindWrite can open it.(You can also set the file creator to "PWRI" so thatit will have the proper icon.) You can do this with<a href="../sw/sysutils/fndrinfo/index.html">Finder Info</a>or<a href="../sw/sysutils/crtrchng/index.html">Creator Changer</a>(or many other possibilities).</p><p>To export MindWrite files, it does have a "Save As" commandthat can write plain text files, and then you can use<a href="../minivmac/extras/exportfl/index.html">ExportFl</a>.It also can export to other file formats such as Mac Writeand some early versions of Microsoft Word. If you write a Wordfile, and then open it with a not quite so old version ofWord (perhaps version 5, which can run in Mini vMac), andsave it again, you could get a file readable by the currentMicrosoft Word, that might preserve some formatting fromthe original.</p><p>Though converting documents to a modern format isuseful in some circumstances, in my opinion it doesnot help to preserve them. Each time the document hasto be updated for the curent software, it will getmodified and munged a little more. Instead, usingan emulator such as Mini vMac allows you to see theoriginal document exactly in its original form. Andit is far less work to maintain one emulator than foreveryone to continually update multiple documents tocurrent formats.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m68"> </a><a href="v2.html#m68">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri Aug 28 00:38:44 2015</p><p>i wish i have an app that runs within a 68k Mac,and capture the ROM, and the rest of the hardware,so the resulting file is an emulated copy of the 68k Mac,and make an image.img of that Mac's HDD for that emulator to boot from.</p><p>that app run within SE/30 that have 8MB RAM, with System 7.1results in a file that emulates a SE/30 with 8MB RAM, running in Mac OS 7.1</p><p>that app run within IIci that have 16MB RAM, with Mac OS 7.5.5results in a file that emulates a SIIci with 16MB RAM, Running Mac OS 7.5.5</p><p>just run the app,select Intel OSX, Windows, PPC OSX, or other OS  for output,than press "Make mini vMac"</p><blockquote><hr><p>(received)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m67"> </a><a href="v2.html#m67">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Fri Aug 21 08:08:23 2015</p><p>the app is not working</p><blockquote><hr><p>I'd need more details to be able to help you.

Once the image is mounted, you can copy files on to it,unmount it, and then transfer the disk image to the computer where youwish to run Mini vMac. (The best way to transfer files to and from yourold Macintosh depends on exactly what hardware you have available.)</p><p>Another approach would be to use the Disk Copy application on yourold Macintosh to create a new disk image, which sounds like whatyou had in mind. This should work, as long as you make sureto create an uncompressed read/write image. It may create a resource fork,but if I recall correctly, the image can still be used in Mini vMacif this resource fork is lost.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m65"> </a><a href="v2.html#m65">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sun Aug 16 12:57:44 2015</p><p>This site looks very helpful re Mini vMac:</p><p>[... a website ...]</p><p> - thanks for your contributions</p><p>t swell</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thanks.

I have the ROM but findno option to generate a Mini vMac app for that Mac. Note, that Macsupports 32,768 colours, but is otherwise very similar to an older Macsuch as a Mac Plus. Remember also that QuickTime did since its verybeginning always support 8 colours, despite screens being black&amp;whiteonly. This means that much of the older software might suddenly showup in nice colours, although having originally been designed mostlyfor the b&amp;w Macs in the first place. That is my main motivation forlooking for a Color Classic variant of Mini vMac, since I have a fewof those applications I would like to run in Mini vMac.</p><p>Any thoughts on that?</p><p>Thanks for your help and cooperation and once more many, many thanksfor Mini vMac.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Andreas Fischlin</p><p>[... email address ...]</p><p><a href="http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/people/afischli">http://www.sysecol.ethz.ch/people/afischli</a></p><blockquote><hr><p>If I remember correctly, the original Macintosh Quickdraw API hasin a few places a limited concept of color, I think mainly intendedfor printing. But whenColor Quickdraw was later created for the Macintosh II, a completelynew and different API was created for color. I don't think much softwaremade any use of the original color API. (relevant<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickDraw#History">Wikipedia</a>.)</p><p>But a lot of software that was written for somewhat later Macintosh computersand use color was made to also work on older computers with onlyblack and white. So a lot of software that works in the Macintosh Plusemulation of Mini vMac will show color if run in the (incomplete)Macintosh II emulation of Mini vMac.</p><p>The Macintosh Color Classic is the same general shape as aMacintosh Plus and targeted for the same marketsegment. But inside, it is directly evolved fromthe Macintosh II and uses thesame Color Quickdraw seen in a Macintosh II.So to emulate a Macintosh Color Classic in Mini vMac, thefirst step is to finish the Macintosh II emulation.

Notme, certainly.</p><p>Rather than making a version of Mini vMac that runs directlyon the hardware, a somewhat more feasible path would be to createa stripped down operating system for running a single program,which a standard Mini vMac could then be run on. Perhaps aversion of Mini vMac compiled to run on SDL. The SDLAPI rather than XLib API may be more appropriate for this purpose.You could start with the source code for the Raspbian linux kernel,SDL, etc., and then start stripping out anything not needed.Since this stripped down OS would run a program that can alsobe run and compiled on the standard Raspbian, that would avoidan enormous amount of work in maintaining a compiler andother development tools.</p><p>This could be a fun project, but I doubt the result wouldrun Mini vMac any faster. That is, even if you did find a way to makeit run Mini vMac faster, that change could probably be made in thefull Raspbian.</p><p>One way Mini vMac could be made to run faster on the Raspberry Piis to make an ARM assembly language version of the 68000 emulation.(There are currently assembly language versions for PowerPCand x86-32.)</p><p>Update: Though it probably wouldn't help with speed, an operatingsystem optimized to run a single program may help in otherways. Not sharing time with other processes may allow smootheremulation. There might also be opportunity to reduce latency, thatis, time between keypress or mouse click, and the result showingup on the screen.</p><p>An operating system to run a single program could be usefulfor other emulators and games, and so attract more people tohelp than making a version of Mini vMac.

Instead, there is a single file to compile,"app.c", that includes ".i" files holding code. Thismakes it easy to compile with a variety of Macintosh developmentenvironments, which may not even use Make files. Forsimple programs, with Mini vMac set to All Out speed, speedof compiling is not an problem (the main original motiviationfor separate compilation).</p><p>See the<a href="../minivmac/appc/index.html">Compiling Macintosh 680x0 Applications</a>for (incomplete) documentation on how to compile the Mini vMacextras.</p><p>&ldquo;LOCALPROC&rdquo; is defined in &ldquo;COREDEFS.i&rdquo;.It is just a convention I adopted long ago when first movingfrom Pascal to C.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m8"> </a><a href="v2.html#m8">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Wed Aug 20 21:20:35 2014</p><p>Hi Paul, I love Mini vMac and am reconstructing what is beginningresemble my favourite computer, the PowerBook 100.
