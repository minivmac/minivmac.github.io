Ithen rebooted to System 7.0.1 (which was downloaded from another resource andbundled with an older version of minivmac), I repeated using Disk Copy 4.2, Iused the same image files, I got the same error -17.

In this case you should first uncompressit on a modern Macintosh, and then transfer the uncompressed files intoa disk image, as described in the Disk Image page." (Oralternatively, use a different emulator, such as Basilisk II.)</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="090828a"> </a><a href="v0.html#090828a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Began</b>: Fri, 28 Aug 2009 00:06:53</p><p>Well, Snow Leopard is upon us.

I don't generally move to a new OS X releaseuntil 10.x.4 or later. And as an open source programmer, i.e. poor,I'm in no hurry to spend money.

Couldyou?? That would be awesome if you could.  I just installedthe latest Mac OS X 10.6 'Snow Leopard' developer preview,and I'm itching to see how mini vmac performs on it in purecocoa.</p><blockquote><hr><p> [me] It should not make much difference to the user whetherMini vMac is programmed in Cocoa or Carbon. Which is why the port toCocoa hasn't happened yet - it's a lot of work for littlebenefit, and there are always other things to do with higherpriority. But Apple doesn't want to waste their time supportingtwo different ways of programming a Macintosh. They'vepicked Cocoa, and are pushing hard to kill Carbon. So Mini vMacwill be need to be ported eventually. </p><hr></blockquote><hr><p> <a name="090720a"> </a><a href="v0.html#090720a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Began</b>: Mon, 20 Jul 2009 13:17:40</p><p>[Vince] In Windows XP (or at least, on my computer), icons in awindow are slightly enlarged to make them easy to read. Thismakes the mini vMac icon slightly fuzzy-looking. I have madea higher-resolution icon for it based on the current one andthe ones for the Mac OS X version.<br>It is now 48x48 pixels - default for an icon in a window.Could I email it to you?</p><blockquote><hr><p> [me] Sure, I'd be interested. I may not include it in thedefault compile, because of the emphasis on minimizingsize. But I could make it publicly available,such as is done for David Sibleys's<a href="../minivmac/extras/icons/index.html">OS X icons</a>.</p><p> Unfortunately, your email address didn't work. </p><hr></blockquote><hr><p> <a name="090714a"> </a><a href="v0.html#090714a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Began</b>: Tue, 14 Jul 2009 13:35:24</p><p> [Charles] Sorry to pester you about this, but I'm wondering what I'mdoing wrong. I've tried building the Mini vMac 3.1.1 withthe following options: </p><pre>-t imch -m IIx -depth 3-t imch -mem 8M -hres 800 -vres 600 -depth 3</pre><blockquote><hr><p> [me] The first line is fine, but the build system won't acceptthe second. I assume there was a "-m IIx" in this one also.You could use<a href="../minivmac/extras/clipout/index.html">ClipOut</a>so I could be sure of exactly what options you are using. </p><blockquote><hr><p> [Charles] Ah, my bad. [...] The original did indeed have a -m IIx in it. [...] </p><hr></blockquote><hr></blockquote><p> However, the resulting build never shows anything but Black&amp; White in the "Monitors" control panel. I know it's*possible* to get color to work, because your prepackagedbuild #27 works fine with color with the same ROM and diskimage. However, I'd like to build it myself, and myperfectionist gene isn't going to allow me to quit until Ifigure out what I've been doing wrong, especially since it'sprobably something fairly simple. </p><p> Any pointers? </p><blockquote><hr><p> [me] What version of XCode are you using? If not 2.4.1, thenyou should use the"<a href="../minivmac/develop.html#option_ev">-ev</a>"option.(the Mini vMac alpha also supports "-ev 3100")</p><p>The generated "CNFGGLOB.h" file should contain the line:</p><pre>"#define vMacScreenDepth 3"</pre><p>Does it?</p><blockquote><hr><p> [Charles] That did it. I'm using Xcode 3.1.2, so I tried adding -ev 3120 and itnow works in color. Thanks! [...] </p><blockquote><hr><p> [me] That narrows down what I should look into. Thanks. </p><hr><p> [me] I've looked into it now, but I wasn't able to reproducethe problem. If you can reproduce the problem, I'd be interestedin seeing the ".tgz" archive the build system generated. Itmay also help to know what system version you're usingin Mini vMac.</p><hr></blockquote><hr></blockquote><hr></blockquote><hr><p> <a name="090707a"> </a><a href="v0.html#090707a">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Began</b>: Tue, 7 Jul 2009 21:54:04</p><p> [Sen Holiday] I've been trying to get the mini vmac to work on my Mac OS X(Intel) laptop, and I've been able to open the old desktopscreen, however I can't interact with it. I can drag thingsinto it and open them in that way, but I can't click onanything on the screen, and my computer doesn't recognizethe mini vmac as the selected program. </p><p> I've no idea what the problem is, but I was pretty fond ofthe old Apple - but as durable as it is, it's dying on me.I'd appreciate any tips. </p><blockquote><hr><p> [me] That's very odd. One thing to try is making a new account onyour computer (System Preferences -> Account Panel, unlockif needed, and click the plus button). Then log in to thenew account, and see if Mini vMac works there. If so,something in your old account is corrupted. (Or possiblyMini vMac might be incompatible with some valid preferencesetting.) </p><p> Otherwise, some further information would be usefulto me: </p><p> * What version of OS X are you using (like 10.4.11 or 10.5.7)? </p><p> * I assume you're using Mini vMac 3.0.4? Does the new<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">alpha</a>version behave the same way? </p><p> * When you say "my computer doesn't recognize the mini vmacas the selected program", do you mean that it doesn't showup in the Dock, and in the Command-Tab list of running programs?Or if it is in the dock, if you control click on its dockicon, do you see some message about application notresponding? (Your description of the problem would beconsistent with Mini vMac completely hanging at some point.) </p><p> * When you say "I can drag things into it and open them inthat way", do you mean dragging disk images onto the MinivMac icon, or can you drag images into the Mini vMac window?Do you mean Mini vMac successfully booted off the disk image(you see the Finder running in the Mini vMac window)? Didyou hear the start up beep? </p><p> * Does keyboard emulation work? If you can drag a bootableimage into Mini vMac, you should be able to try Command-A,Command-O, Command-W (Select All, Open, Close). Otherwise,does the Mini vMac control mode work? That is, if you holddown the control key, do you see the Control Mode overlay(with the words: "Control Mode (Type 'H' for help)")?(If Mini vMac is completely hung, then neither of thesewill work.) </p><p> * What other non Apple software have you installed?Especially, what software that required an administratorpassword to install? </p><blockquote><hr>[Sen] Oh, wow. Nope, the alpha version works perfectly. Thanks for getting back tome so quickly and with so much detail--I'm really looking forward to usingthis!<blockquote><hr>[me] Well, good.
