Another possibility isthat  Mini vMac has code to exit full screen when itdetects that it is no longer the active application, i.e.something else has grabbed focus.

If another Desk Accessory is already runningin DA Handler, then after ClipIn quits the DA Handler remainsthe active application.

This gives quitegood, but not perfect, compatibility.&rdquo;</p><p>For Full Screen Mode, it is intended behavior to cover all screens.In Full Screen Mode, Mini vMac will use a more accurate emulationof the Macintosh mouse, that looks at motion of the mouse on the hostcomputer, rather than its absolute position. So you can, forexample, scroll to the right for as long as you want, and stillbe generating mouse motion in the emulated machine, rather thangetting stuck at the edge of the screen. Which is important forsome games.</p><p>For the method Mini vMac uses to get mouse motion, there isa small chance of undesirable behavior if all screens were notcovered. I think there is a better way on OS X to get mouse motionwhich doesn't have this problem, but even then I'm not sureit would be desirable to have other programs on other screens,but no way to move the mouse over to them. That would likelyresult in confusion and bug reports.</p><p>An alternative would be to not use the more accurate mouseemulation. There is already a compile time option forthis,&ldquo;<a href="../minivmac/options.html#option_emm">-emm 0</a>&rdquo;.So perhaps when this option is chosen, then Mini vMac couldnot cover all screens in Full screen mode, and the mousecould be moved off the screen containing Mini vMac as normal.Unfortunately, I'm unlikely to have time to implement thisin the foreseeable future.

(patchfiles, some sort of version control...)</p><p>-vasi</p><p>[... email address ...]</p><blockquote><hr><p>Sorry for the delay due to travel.</p><p>Sure, you are quite welcome to add this feature to Mini vMac. WhetherI'd include it in the version I maintain is a bit more of a question.The biggest issue is that I currently have very limited time to workon Mini vMac. I don't tend to merge in code unless I understandit thoroughly, and have edited it to follow the source code conventionsof Mini vMac, which takes time. It depends a lot onhow complex the code is. (It wouldn't help that much for you totry to make your code follow Mini vMac conventions exactly,because that editing pass is part of my way of understanding code.)</p><p>As to how to get changes to me, the easiest may be to just postit on the web somewhere, in the form of the complete sourcecode that compiles for you. (Or you could just email me yoursource archive.) I have my own preferred tools forfinding the differences.</p><p>Even if I didn't merge your changes immediately to my version,I would still publicize it to make it available to others.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v2.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v3- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
