It is a lot better in Mini vMac 37, but stillpresent. Something throws out the timing of MIDI audio tracks, so thatyou cannot get through extended music sequences without some amount ofstuttering and musical instruments temporarily going out of sync. I havenever been able to resolve it with settings or speed changes. It affectsall the LucasArts games, but is particularly noticeable in the lattergames that use the "iMuse" dynamic musical scoring system, such asMonkey Island 2 and Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.

I distinctly remember itbeing there a few years ago. Of course I downloaded the source, createda compile VM, it spat out the files for MPV, I dug up my memories on howto compile it (on real OS 9) and.. it was so buggy it froze right afterboot. Then I tried playing with the parameters and using differentsystem images (6.0.8, 7.1, 7.6.1), but to no avail.</p><p>Is it possible to produce an executable for me for said platform (MacII,sound, 800x600x256)? Or was that host platform abandoned for a reason,e.g. not enough interest, difficulty in fixing bugs etc.? I mostly justwant to play Hellcats Over the Pacific on OS 9.2.2 but the last versionit works on without a black screen is on is 9.0.4, so Mini vMac is myonly hope. Sure, I know I might as well play it on my main machine butmy OS 9 box has all my newer games so it would be really nice.</p><p>I will, of course, gladly pay for a variations subscription to supportyour work.</p><p>Best regards,<br> [... name ...]</p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : received, work pending</p><p>Thanks for the bug report. Mini vMac 37 just entered Beta, so thisa good time for me to test compiling for Mac OS 9. I have somememory that the very last MPW compilers were buggy, and it wasnecessary to use earlier ones. But that might have been forthe 680x0 compile and not the PowerPC version used for Mac OS 9.</p><p>Unfortunately, I stopped producing official binaries for Mac OS 9and earlier when I moved to using a set of cross compilerscompiled from a single version of GCC. Using these crosscompilers is very convenient, and allowed speeding up theVariations service from minutes to seconds. (The current formof the Variations service would not be viable if a compilecould take minutes.) But I have decided this compiler set is toolimited, and for Mini vMac 37 figured out how to get the same speed withmultiple compilers on multiple platforms by throwing more hardware atthe problem (especially memory). This made possible supporting the newApple Silicon.</p><p>So now it is relatively easy to support any platform that has aC compiler that runs on some (possibly other) intel platform that hasan SSH server and Bash. Which doesn&rsquo;t directly help for supportingMac OS 9 using MPW. One possibility is to try the Retro68 compileragain. I couldn&rsquo;t get it to work some years back, but it lookslike significant work has been done on it since. Another possibility issome enhancements to Mini vMac to allow better coordination with MPWrunning in emulation, along with some other tricks.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m281"> </a><a href="v12.html#m281">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Mon, 16 Nov 2020 11:33:05</p><p>Hey Paul,<p>Was wondering if you had any insight into this issue that I've postedabout on the e-maculation forums:</p><a href="https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=10902">https://www.emaculation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=10902</a><p>Basically, I'm unable to get sound working on a Raspberry Pi4 with vMaccompiled with SDL and ALSA.

The code for using sdl istrying to be as platform independent as possible, and does notimplement using alsa directly. The build system attempts toverify that any regular options used are valid, and any combinationof them that doesn't work and the build system didn't catchis a bug. This is not true for developer options like&ldquo;-snd-api alsa&rdquo; and &ldquo;-api sdl&rdquo;,since often what is desired is to generate as close as possible toworking when porting to a new platform. I should document thisdistinction.</p><p>I thought SDL provides its own options for choosing how soundis implemented. Also I would think alsa is normally the defaultfor SDL on linux.

But running out of disk space is aboutthe only error that could occur where an error file mightbe successfully written. And then looking for that error messagewould need to be documented. It might be simpler to just documentthat a zero length file means not enough disk space.</p><p>So I have done that, adding a paragraph to the<a href="../minivmac/extras/copyroms/index.html">CopyRoms</a>documentation.</p><p> <i>update - <a href="v12.html#m271">follow-up message</a></i> </p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m269"> </a><a href="v12.html#m269">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: (via email) Mon, 21 Sep 2020 23:17:38</p><p>Hi,<br>I'm not sure how much you check Twitter, so I'm emailing you too.After some time debugging, I found out why Winter Games doesn't work inMini vMac (and fixed it):</p><p>Wintergames modifies the VBL queue directly, inserting its own task at thehead instead of calling VInstall, but it doesn't account for thepossibility of the queue being empty, since on a real Mac the queue wouldhave the task installed by the .Sony driver to track the disk speed (Ithink that's what it does, it's DT81 under P_Sony_FigTrkSpd in the Mac PlusROM disassembly).</p><p>I fixed it in the replacement .Sony driver, by adding a task that doesnothing to the queue, similar to how the time task is already added.</p><p>You can find my fix here, I'd be glad for it to be included in a futureversion of Mini vMac:<br><a href="https://github.com/zydeco/minivmac/commit/53c291ac120a036131a73cb2e568b57c493f51d7">https://github.com/zydeco/minivmac/commit/53c291ac120a036131a73cb2e568b57c493f51d7</a></p><blockquote><hr><p><b>status</b> : patch merged</p><p>Thanks! That&rsquo;s impressive debugging. The patch is nowmerged into my development version.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve made a few changes. Moving the VInstall blockbefore the conditional branch instead of after allows it towork in Macintosh 128K emulation. Putting the record forthe VBL task into the SonyVars structure instead of callingNewPtr may help minimize differences from previous versions.Changing the VBLTaskFreq to once a minute (instead of the maximum ofabout 9 minutes) may make it easier to notice if this taskis having any unexpected effect.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v11.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v12- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2020 Paul C.
