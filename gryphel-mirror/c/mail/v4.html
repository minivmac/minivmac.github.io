Let&rsquo;s say I can read but not write thatwell. I am more of a designer. So I decided to make things as ready aspossible, that was the aim.</p><p>The &ecirc; chars were a miss, sorry about that, I hate my language! It isunpractical... great for love letters, but awful to the day by daypractices. There are mainly 2 branches of portuguese, pt_PT used byPortugal, Angola, etc, and pt_BR used only in Brazil. More or lessenglish from S and UK, that have very feel changes and a lot of accentdifferent pronunciations, so Brazilian Portuguese is the properdenomination. But as with UK/US english, all portuguese speaking peoplescan read that with no effort, considering they know how to read.</p><p>Changes are usually little words to describe things. For instance, I&rsquo;veread somewhere that the word napkin in Australia means women's sanitaryproduct. Here for instance we have the word &ldquo;paneleiro&rdquo; derived from&ldquo;panela&rdquo; (cooking pot) that means someone that cannot surf, there meanshomosexual in a derogatory way. Things like that that you cannot miss.But I&rsquo;ve believe there are little to zero radically different words likethat in the translation and any portuguese language speaking person canunderstand 100% of it.</p><p>Yes I&rsquo;ve used the english localization as starting point, the commentswere untouched aside from the name.

I have merged your translation in the latest<a href="../minivmac/alpha.html">Development</a> source snapshot.</p><p>I see you are a programmer, and your translation is already inthe encoding used by Mini vMac. That made merging easy. Idid make a few changes: (1) You appear to have started fromthe English translation, which had the copyright&ldquo;Paul C. Pratt, Pierre Lemieux&rdquo; (I originally created thisfile, and later used suggestions made by Pierre Lemieux). For your translationI have changed this to &ldquo;Mauricio, Paul C. Pratt&rdquo;.(2) I updated the copyright date to 2017.(3) Removed a few spaces to change comment format back to Mini vMacstyle, which is enforced by some scripts of mine (so I can't easilymake exceptions).(4) In five places, the character &ecirc; was not in the Mini vMacencoding (&ldquo;;ie&rdquo;). (5) Renamed the file to match thenew style in the development branch. (6) Changed the commentto say that is Brazilian Portuguese, instead of just Portuguese.Which I'm not so sure about.</p><p>I gather from Wikipedia that the written form of Brazilian Portugueseis much closer to other Portuguese than the spoken form, butnot identical. So I'm not clear, is your translation specificallyBrazilian Portuguese, or would it be acceptable to speakers ofall other forms of Portuguese?</p><p>Another question, do you prefer to only use your first name,or would like your last name to appear in the copyright notice,credits file, news, and such?

The Mac II support seems tobe almost perfect now .. I have a range of games working flawlessly incolor in both Systems 6 and 7. It is amazing to see games like Vetteworking in 16 color mode, which I was never able to do with alternativesoftware like Basilisk and SheepShaver.</p><p>My only problem is with how Mini vMac is functioning with QuickTime.Some games like Myst will tend to (randomly) crash during the QuickTimemovie sequences, and other games will play the movies too quickly, orthe sound will go out of sync with the video.</p><p>I have experimented with a range of builds (all Mac II)  across varioussystems (7.1 to 7.5.5), speeds (x1 up to all out)  and differentQuickTime versions (1.6 up to 2.5 from memory), but nothing is reallyhelping. It is erratic and unpredictable, and seems to be related toQuickTime itself, as the affected games will all work perfectly up tothe point QuickTime is utilized.</p><p>Are you aware of any specific issues that affect Mini vMac's performancewith the QuickTime software?</p><p>If so, do you know of any build options that I could use which mightimprove QuickTime performance or stability?</p><p>Thanks again for all your hard work on this excellent software.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Adam Meath</p><p>Perth, Western Australia</p><blockquote><hr><p>It is good that much software works well in the incompleteMacintosh II emulation.</p><p>Currently, the biggest thing known to be incomplete is theFPU emulation (for floating point arithmetic).

The emulation stops and eventually Windows grays the vMacwindow and adds "Not Responding" to the window title. However, if youclick the vMac window then after about ten to fifteen seconds theemulation resumes and Mini vMac and the Mac software again responds.This cycle quickly repeats again though so these particular titles arenot really usable at this point.</p><p>I'm running System 7.1 within Mini vMac and I can provide samples of thesystem software and applications if it would assist with investigation.The specific Mini vMac build was created in September using the downloadservice on the homepage. It's mnvm5993-3.4.1 using the followingoptions: -t wx86 -m II -depth 2 -sss 4 -drives 8.</p><p>For StuffIt Lite the lockup occurs whenever an archive window isopeneded with the application. With SimCity 2000 it happens whenever thesimulation is actually running (not when paused). It doesn't seem toaffect the upgraded 1.2 version of SimCity 2000 though.</p><p>Thanks!</p><p>Stephen Barbieri</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thank you for the detailed bug report. I was able to reproduce thisissue in a different version of StuffIt. It appears that theSoftFloat code used by Mini vMac for FPU emulationdoesn't cope well with invalid input. I put in another check in thedivide function, the same place where I had put in a checka long time ago for a similar issue, and it seems to prevent thepause.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m7"> </a><a href="v4.html#m7">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Thu Dec 22 21:08:50 2016</p><p>[<a href="v4.html#m3">previous message</a>]</p><p>It might also be useful linking to the content on web.archive.org andensuring all your own site gets regular backups there via an explicitrobots.txt entry.</p><blockquote><hr><p>Links to web.archive.org could be a good idea, I&rsquo;ll consider it.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m6"> </a><a href="v4.html#m6">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat Dec 17 01:25:58 2016</p><p>Paul,</p><p>Can you send us a message at [... email address ...] when you make yourupdates so that we can cover them on our website and in our magazine.</p><p>Thanks Much</p><p>Bill Martens</p><p>A.P.P.L.E.</p><p>www.callapple.org</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thank you for your interest.

Maybe it has something to do with buildsthat are made for more than 256 colors not supporting 256 color mode (Imean, in BasiliskII one version supports different color modes and youcan choose under "Monitors" in MacOS do you want 256 colors, thousandsof colors or millions colors... but with Mini vMac if you are using abuild for "thousands of colors", then you don't get "256 colors" modeunder "Monitors")... Please see if you can make one version that cansupport 256 colors, thousands of colors and millions of colors at thesame time (so you can just choose under "Monitors" how many colors youwant)... and could you also add support for more than just 4MB of RAM,if it's not too complicated? BTW... You don't have to reply... I'm justsending a suggestion that I think would improve Mini vMac :)</p><blockquote><hr><p>It seems unlikely that having 256 colors as an option would haveeffect on the Thousands or Millions of Colors modes, thoughI guess it isn't impossible.</p><p>The Macintosh II emulation supports 8MB of RAM. More than thatis tricky since the ROM isn&rsquo;t 32 bit clean.</p><p>I had looked into hacking the Macintosh Plus emulation to supportmore the 4MB of RAM, by moving the ROM image in the address space,and concluded it wasn&rsquo;t feasible, because ROM patches in theoperating system depend on the exact location of ROM routines.</p><hr></blockquote><p><a name="end">:</a></p><p><a href="v3.html">Older Mail</a>(<a href="index.html">Index</a>)</p><hr><div><i> <a href="../../index.html">www.gryphel.com</a>/c/<a href="index.html">mail</a>/v4- <a href="../feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2016 Paul C.
