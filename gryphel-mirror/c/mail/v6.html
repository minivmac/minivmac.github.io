What I&rsquo;m currentlyseeing on the web page for this variation matches what thebuild server generated.</p><p>But neither of these is proof.Instead, you can check the integrity of what you have downloadedby using the signed checksum on the download page, the publickey for the Variations Service(<a href="../keys/k2.html">Gryphel Key 2</a>),the<a href="../minivmac/extras/sigcheck/index.html">SigCheck</a>tool and the<a href="../minivmac/extras/md5im/index.html">Md5Im</a>tool.</p><p>By coincidence, I just got all that set up in the past weeks. Itstill is not absolute proof, but it would be exciting if someonecould break that signing, as it would require capabilities thathave not been publicly demonstrated yet. (Such as factoring a1024 bit number, or making an md5 collision with an alreadyexisting file.) Or, of course, someone could have hacked thebuild server, but that would seem difficult, as it is not actuallya server on the internet in the usual sense.</p><p>For further safety, you can try out new software in a virtual machinebefore installing it on your real machine, using virtualization softwaresuch as <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> or <ahref="http://www.vmware.com">VMware</a>. I tend to think that theonly software that should run on the real machine is virtualizationsoftware, but I make some exceptions, like Mini vMac.

Now Iget the point and I'm slightly flummoxed.</p><p>It seems that it's actually impossible to compile Mini vMac as 64-bitCocoa using Xcode because of mac68k alignment pragma being disabled inApple's tools? Not only that, but even on the 32-bit build there's somelinking issue involving empty symbol tables which seems to have been aproblem since the release of Sierra over a year ago now. (again, due toa change in Apple's version of dyld, I admit.) I realize you're not anearly adopter, but surely you'd be on Sierra by now? (Apologies if yourMac doesn't support anything past El Capitan.)</p><p>And then I noticed that you personally use an automated system whichcross compiles from a standard GNU toolchain seemingly? The VariationsSystem seems to sidestep a far more than trivial effort, even for thereasonably technically inclined. I feel slightly conned into giving youa donation to even just configure the program the way I'd like. I'mstill sorting through how I feel about that. It's not like I stopped atthe first stumbling block, either, I had to find and add back in the10.4u SDK, then delete a "floats.h" in said SDK that was throwing othererrors but was only there for compatibility reasons now 10 yearsobsolete. None of these are even really to do with your code, that I'venoticed, it seems if I had a machine running Tiger or even El Capitannext to me I'd be up and running just fine. :/</p><p>To the point: are you planning on making Mini vMac buildable using arecent Xcode again? I know there's a ton of competing concerns there,this isn't a trivial amount of work for you either. (Potentially eveninvolving a new Mac, of course.) If you plan on doing so, though, I'd behappy to throw a donation your way the next time I balance my owncheckbook.</p><p>Thank you very much for your work on the Project, I hope this didn'tcome across too bitter.</p><p><b>Sent</b>: Sat Nov 25 03:34:37 2017</p><p>An addendum to the last comment about building in recent Xcode: Couldyou potentially detail your personal build workflow? If that's theofficial way to build it maybe that's just what I should do as well.</p><blockquote><hr><p>Thank you for the feedback. It does help to illustrate thepoint of the Variations Service.</p><p>First, I suspect part of your problem is that you are not using the&ldquo;-ev&rdquo; option to specify a version of Xcode. Withoutthat it defaults to Xcode 2.4.1, which is ancient. I shouldchange that default. The last version supported Apple Xcode 8.2.1,with &ldquo;-ev 8210&rdquo;. This was current when Mini vMac 3.5.xwas being developed at the beginning of the year. Xcode has afaster development cycle. But a Mini vMac project generated forXcode 8.2.1 will probably work much better with current Xcodethan one for Xcode 2.4.1.</p><p>Whenever Mini vMac is compiled with a compiler or compiler versionit hasn&rsquo;t been compiled with before, there is a good chancethat it will work fine, but there is also a good chance it won&rsquo;t.Further, if someone tries to compile Mini vMac for the first time,there is a good chance they will run in to problems, from notunderstanding their development tools, or not reading the documentation,or that the documentation isn&rsquo;t clear enough. In any of these situationspeople might contact me. And if more than a handful of people askme for help in compiling, it is completely impossible. So I&rsquo;mtending towards strongly discouraging people from trying to compile MinivMac from source unless they are experienced programmer familiar withtheir compiler, who wants to work with the source code, and not someonewho is just trying to compile a version of Mini vMac.</p><p>This is not just because of the current funding model. When thevariation service was free and not so automated, I still preferredpeople use it rather than trying to compile. Because it only tooka few extra seconds for me to compile an additional variation, whileit takes a least 15 minutes to answer a question aboutcompiling, and often much more.</p><p>Sorry, I have no plans to publish, and especially not to support,the gcc cross compilers I have built. For the reasons above, plusbandwidth costs for my server (the complete set with supporting files is large).If anyone really wants to, they can build their own with (currently)&ldquo;gcc-4.7.4, gmp-4.3.2, mpfr-2.4.2, mpc-0.8.1,and mingw-w64-v4.0.6&rdquo;.</p><p>I expect as the Mini vMac 3.6 branch is developed, I will add supportfor the current Xcode and Visual Studio compilers. Which again willlikely be obsolete while Mini vMac 3.6 is still current.</p><p>It is true that some open source projects may be easier to compile.But that would tend to be large projects with many people working onthem. If you count &ldquo;most&rdquo; in terms of eachopen source project, rather than each instance of open source beingused, then the typical open source project was maintained by oneperson who burned out because the costs grew as it became morepopular and resources didn&rsquo;t, and it is now a dead project.</p><hr></blockquote><p> <a name="m23"> </a><a href="v6.html#m23">permanent link</a></p><p><b>Sent</b>: Tue Nov 21 18:29:10 2017</p><p>You've worked on this a lot.
