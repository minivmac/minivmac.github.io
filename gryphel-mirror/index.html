Except that they arenot reproducible builds yet. It does not seem to be possible to clearjunk out of the &ldquo;Reserved for system use&rdquo; area of aresource fork without the operating system immediately puttingjunk back in. Another approach would be to have to my tool forcreating a &ldquo;.sit&rdquo; archive file clear this area in itsoutput.</p><p><a name="n210309"> <b>March 9, 2021</b> </a>- <a href="c/news/nva9.html#n210309">permanent link</a></p><p>I noticed that some Apple System Software disk images I havefail the new test in Mini vMac 37 that is designed to protect filesthat aren&rsquo;t actually Macintosh disk images by refusing to mountthem. (The <a href="c/minivmac/options.html#option_ndp">-ndp</a> option,which defaults to on.) The boot blocks of these System Softwareimages are garbage.</p><p>So today&rsquo;s<a href="c/minivmac/beta.html">Mini vMac 37.03</a>beta no longer looks at the boot blocks, but only checks themaster directory block.</p><p><a name="n210214"> <b>February 14, 2021</b> </a>- <a href="c/news/nva9.html#n210214">permanent link</a></p><p>The <a href="c/minivmac/extras/sigwrttl/index.html">SigWrtTl</a>command line tool now supports multiple platforms, as was donefor SigChkTl.</p><p>While doing this, I worked out how to automate compiling commandline tools using a networked virtual machine (in this case tocompile for Apple Silicon), like is done for theMini vMac Variations Service. To finish being able to compilefor all supported platform with one command, I next should figureout how to automate compiling command line tools for m68k.Perhaps by using, for now, the technique used for compilingMini vMac 3.5 for m68k, which is slower than current methods,but fast enough when not for the Variations Service.</p><p><a name="n210130"> <b>January 30, 2021</b> </a>- <a href="c/news/nva9.html#n210130">permanent link</a></p><p>A<a href="c/minivmac/local/zh_hans.html">Chinese translation</a>for the Mini vMac user interface has beenanonymously <a href="c/mail/v12.html#m291">contributed</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, as mentioned on the<a href="c/minivmac/local/index.html">Mini vMac Localization</a>page, displaying Chinese characters is not currently feasible forMini vMac.I used Google Translate to convert the characters into Pinyin, andadded a<a href="c/minivmac/local/zh_latn.html">Chinese Pinyin</a> page.This translation can be included in the next branch of Mini vMac.But I gather, from people who have previously considered doing theChinese translation(<a href="c/mail/v4.html#m30">1</a><a href="c/mail/v10.html#m185">2</a><a href="c/mail/v11.html#m257">3</a>),that it would not be very useful.(Elsewhere I have seen it compared to an English speaker tryingto read English written in the International Phonetic Alphabet.Even without previous practice it is doable, but slow and awkward.)</p><p> Previous news -	<a href="c/news/nva9.html">News Archive</a></p><p> : </p><p>Thanks toDonald Shepherd,Chris Hanson,Stephen Barbieri,Benjamin Yackley,Samuel Davidoff,Chad Stanke,Colin Ng,Andrew Macfarlane,John Miller,Mark Smith,Todd Katz,Steve Torello,Byron Formwalt,Katherine Palacios,Dallin Pincock,David Goodson,Jay Petersen,James Weiner,Roger Clark,Keith Palmer,Andy McConn,Felix Orsini,Elliot Nunn,Herbert Wetli,Pacific Alarms,Olivier SIGG,Sylvain Pellet,Yvan BARTHELEMY,Tim Johnson,Richard McConnell,Dimitri Boone,Andrew Richards,Steven Hirsch,Ton van der Liet,Vincent Penichou,Reinhard Zielinski,Pierre Beck,Klaus Ritter,Christopher Courtney,Robert Hoppe,Jerome Acks,Martin Nobel,Nathan Lee,Jose Manuel Mendez Magan,Marie Friis,Jason Galarneau,Cedric Tremblay,Deborah Carne,Michael Sprague,Andrew Y.,Attila Fehervari,Jesse Cochran,Manu Heikkila,Parinya Tantasin,Kamil Korolczuk,Jan Baumgartner,Shearwood Frames,Carl Lewis,Richard Cini,Chris Hanson,Michael Dennis,Jim Dickison,Glenn Petrie,Nicolas Geissler,Padawer,Chris Hanson,Anthony Easa,John Schilling,Holger Burmester,Michael Grundmann,Conscious Shell,Guillermo Grana Gomez,Luke Anderson,Matthew McFarlane,Chris Hanson,Jason Buss,Toby Ord,Jadan Sloan,Codey Vargas,Wesley Wilkinson,Peter Krstanovski,Xiangtian Wei,James Licata,Ian Murray,David Templeton,Benjamin Watson,Galen Tackett,Michael Longval,Jeff Halter,Mark Brethen,Mohamed El-Rouby,Deniz Ersu,Tam Chi Hang Keith,Jonathan Badger,Casey Mulvihill,Galen Hunt,Cloud Propeller, Inc.,Carly Marshiano,Chris Rutter,Ryan Fialcowitz,Anonymous,Dean Brissinger,Anonymous,Chaled Schmidt,twocargar Multimedia,R D Bridges,Berend Vosmer,0xroy,keith struan,Steve Crutchfield,Mario Cavigli,Tak Chung Lung,Ben Lacara,Ignacio Arango Valderrama,robert lloyd,James Adams,Thomas Teixeira,David Steedman,Alessandro Bruno,Brian Martin,Jeremy Landry,Jacob Ochs,Gianluca Abbiati,Brielle Harrison,G2K Argentina S.A.,Piotr Jaczewski,david frydman,Maxim Prochshenko,Mason Shell,and Josh Youngfor <a href="c/wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>184 days of health insurance.</p><p>Thanks toYu Tsz Lui,Edzard Ceadda Stanislaus III,Arnaud Abbati,Scrutinize My System,and John Leakefor <a href="c/wishlist/index.html">sponsoring</a>15 months of web hosting for the Gryphel project.</p><p> <img src="d/gryphel-64.gif" width=64 height=64	alt="gryphel logo, 1K"> </p><hr><div><i> www.gryphel.com- <a href="c/feedback.html">feedback</a> </i><br>copyright (c) 2019 Paul C.
